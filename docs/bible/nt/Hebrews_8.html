<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this: we have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> a servant of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched, not man.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For finding fault with them, he said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> the days are coming”, says the Lord,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they didn’t continue in my covenant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I disregarded them,” says the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>after those days,” says the Lord:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“I will put my laws into their mind;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will also write them on their heart.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will be their God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will be my people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> They will not teach every man his fellow citizen<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for all will know me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>from their least to their greatest.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> In that he says, “A new covenant”, he has made the first obsolete. But that which is becoming obsolete and grows aged is near to vanishing away.</div>
