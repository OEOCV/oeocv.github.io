<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to those of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for the past year. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But I have sent the brothers so that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> lest by any means, if anyone from Macedonia comes there with me and finds you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) would be disappointed in this confident boasting.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> As it is written,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“He has scattered abroad. He has given to the poor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>His righteousness remains forever.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> you being enriched in everything for all generosity, which produces thanksgiving to God through us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through much giving of thanks to God,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ and for the generosity of your contribution to them and to all,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!</div>
