<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> God didn’t reject his people, whom he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> “Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have broken down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Even so too at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.” <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> David says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Let their table be made a snare, a trap,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Always keep their backs bent.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear;</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“There will come out of Zion the Deliverer,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> This is my covenant with them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when I will take away their sins.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> For God has bound all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> “For who has known the mind of the Lord?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or who has been his counselor?”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> “Or who has first given to him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and it will be repaid to him again?”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> For of him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.</div>
