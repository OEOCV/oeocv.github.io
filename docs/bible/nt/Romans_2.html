<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> but to those who are self-seeking and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath, indignation,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> oppression, and anguish on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For there is no partiality with God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> (for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, rest on the law, glory in God,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal?</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> You who glory in the law, do you dishonor God by disobeying the law?</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> just as it is written.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Won’t those who are physically uncircumcised, but fulfill the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</div>
