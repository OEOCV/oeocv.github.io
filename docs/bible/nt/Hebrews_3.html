<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> but Christ<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Today if you will hear his voice,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> don’t harden your hearts as in the rebellion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the day of the trial in the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> where your fathers tested me and tried me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and saw my deeds for forty years.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore I was displeased with that generation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and said, ‘They always err in their heart,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but they didn’t know my ways.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> As I swore in my wrath,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘They will not enter into my rest.’”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> while it is said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Today if you will hear his voice,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> For who, when they heard, rebelled? Wasn’t it all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> We see that they weren’t able to enter in because of unbelief.</div>
