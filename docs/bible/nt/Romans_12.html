<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For I say through the grace that was given me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us: if prophecy, let’s prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> or service, let’s give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> or he who exhorts, to his exhorting; he who gives, let him do it with generosity; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor prefer one another,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> rejoicing in hope, enduring in troubles, continuing steadfastly in prayer,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> contributing to the needs of the saints, and given to hospitality.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.” <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Therefore<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“If your enemy is hungry, feed him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>If he is thirsty, give him a drink;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Don’t be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</div>
