<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>Paul’s Letter to the Galatians</h2><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> and all the brothers<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> before God, I’m not lying.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> So they glorified God in me.</div>
