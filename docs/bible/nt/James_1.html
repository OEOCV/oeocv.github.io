<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>The Letter from James</h2><span class="vn">1</span> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Count it all joy, my brothers,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> when you fall into various temptations,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For that man shouldn’t think that he will receive anything from the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For the sun arises with the scorching wind and withers the grass; and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So the rich man will also fade away in his pursuits.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Blessed is a person who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord promised to those who love him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Let no man say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God can’t be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin. The sin, when it is full grown, produces death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Don’t be deceived, my beloved brothers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation nor turning shadow.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> for the anger of man doesn’t produce the righteousness of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn’t bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man’s religion is worthless.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</div>
