<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore, select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The word of God increased and the number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines”, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, then brought him in to the council,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.</div>
