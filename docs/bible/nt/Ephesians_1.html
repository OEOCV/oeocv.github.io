<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without defect before him in love,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely gave us favor in the Beloved.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> In him we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> We were also assigned an inheritance in him, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who does all things after the counsel of his will,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> In him you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation—in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and the love which you have toward all the saints,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> don’t cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> having the eyes of your hearts<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> which he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> far above all rule, authority, power, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</div>
