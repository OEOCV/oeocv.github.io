<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy</h2><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For this cause I also suffer these things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</div>
