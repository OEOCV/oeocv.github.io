<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel that are of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Neither, because they are Abraham’s offspring, are they all children. But, “your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as heirs.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For this is a word of promise: “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> it was said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Even as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For he said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> What if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory—</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> As he says also in Hosea,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“I will call them ‘my people,’ which were not my people;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and her ‘beloved,’ who was not beloved.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> “It will be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Isaiah cries concerning Israel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>it is the remnant who will be saved;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because the Lord will make a short work upon the earth.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> As Isaiah has said before,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Unless the Lord of Armies<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> had left us a seed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>we would have become like Sodom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and would have been made like Gomorrah.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn’t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn’t arrive at the law of righteousness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Why? Because they didn’t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> even as it is written,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup></div>
