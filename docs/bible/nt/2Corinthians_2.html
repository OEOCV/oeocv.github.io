<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For if I make you grieve, then who will make me glad but he who is made to grieve by me?</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> And I wrote this very thing to you, so that when I came, I wouldn’t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy would be shared by all of you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made to grieve, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> This punishment which was inflicted by the many is sufficient for such a one;</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> so that, on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God in those who are saved and in those who perish:</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> to the one a stench from death to death, to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</div>
