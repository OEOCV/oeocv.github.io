<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book or to look in it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Then I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look in it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> One of the elders said to me, “Don’t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome: he who opens the book and its seven seals.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I saw in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> They sang a new song, saying,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“You are worthy to take the book<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and to open its seals,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for you were killed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and bought us for God with your blood<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and made us kings and priests to our God;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and we will reign on the earth.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I looked, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. The number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
