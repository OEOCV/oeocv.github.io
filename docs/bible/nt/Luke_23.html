<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He answered him, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">So</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">say</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> I will therefore chastise him and release him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it after Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.</div>

<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.</div>
<div class="v" id="v54"><span class="vn">54</span> It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.</div>
<div class="v" id="v55"><span class="vn">55</span> The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.</div>
