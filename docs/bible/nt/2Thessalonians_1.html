<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you toward one another abounds,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of God’s Kingdom, for which you also suffer.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> punishing those who don’t know God, and to those who don’t obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints and to be admired among all those who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> To this end we also pray always for you that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith with power,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> that the name of our Lord Jesus<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</div>
