<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For we all stumble in many things. Anyone who doesn’t stumble in word is a perfect person, able to bridle the whole body also.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind;</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in the image of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against the truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</div>
