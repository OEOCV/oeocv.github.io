<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>Paul’s Letter to Titus</h2><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you—</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</div>
