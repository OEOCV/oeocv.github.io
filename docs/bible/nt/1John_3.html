<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t know him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Beloved, now we are children of God. It is not yet revealed what we will be; but we know that when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him just as he is.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and no sin is in him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Whoever remains in him doesn’t sin. Whoever sins hasn’t seen him and doesn’t know him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of the devil.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Whoever is born of God doesn’t commit sin, because his seed remains in him, and he can’t sin, because he is born of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn’t do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn’t love his brother.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another—</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> unlike Cain, who was of the evil one and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s righteous.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Don’t be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn’t love his brother remains in death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But whoever has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need, then closes his heart of compassion against him, how does God’s love remain in him?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> My little children, let’s not love in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> And by this we know that we are of the truth and persuade our hearts before him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have boldness toward God;</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> so whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</div>
