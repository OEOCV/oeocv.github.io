<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> The same was in the beginning with God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> He came to his own, and those who were his own didn’t receive him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name:</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> The Word became flesh and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the only born<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’”</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> No one has seen God at any time. The only born<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Son,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said, “I am not.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Are you the prophet?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He answered, “No.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> as Isaiah the prophet said.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> They asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> John answered them, “I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water, that he would be revealed to Israel.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">What</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">are</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">looking</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span>?”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), “where are you staying?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> He said to them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Come</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">and</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">see</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day.

<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being interpreted, Christ<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup>).</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> He brought him to Jesus.

<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip.

<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Philip said to him, “Come and see.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Behold</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">an</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Israelite</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">indeed</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">in</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">whom</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> no <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">deceit</span>!”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
