<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Ananias departed and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> He took food and was strengthened.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> All who heard him were amazed, and said, “Isn’t this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> but their plot became known to Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> but his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> He was with them entering into<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Jerusalem,</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> but they were seeking to kill him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> When the brothers<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> So the assemblies throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were built up. They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> As Peter went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years because he was paralyzed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!” Immediately he arose.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated means Dorcas.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> In those days, she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> Peter got up and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper room. All the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the tunics and other garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> Peter sent them all out, and knelt down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> He gave her his hand and raised her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> This became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> He stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.</div>
