<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could count, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> They cried with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne, and worshiped God,</div>
