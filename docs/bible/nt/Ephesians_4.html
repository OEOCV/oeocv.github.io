<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> There is one body and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in us all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> But to each one of us, the grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore he says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“When he ascended on high,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he led captivity captive,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and gave gifts to people.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Now this, “He ascended”, what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> and teachers;</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> They, having become callous, gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> But you didn’t learn Christ that way,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> if indeed you heard him and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> “Be angry, and don’t sin.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Don’t let the sun go down on your wrath,</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> and don’t give place<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> to the devil.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, producing with his hands something that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but only what is good for building others up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Don’t grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander be put away from you, with all malice.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> And be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you.</div>
