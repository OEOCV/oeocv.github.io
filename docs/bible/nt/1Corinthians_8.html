<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But anyone who loves God is known by him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For though there are things that are called “gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth—as there are many “gods” and many “lords”—</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of an idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat are we the worse, nor if we eat are we the better.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble.</div>
