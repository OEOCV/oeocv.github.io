<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast, but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> I know a man in Christ who was caught up into the third heaven fourteen years ago—whether in the body, I don’t know, or whether out of the body, I don’t know; God knows.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don’t know; God knows),</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> how he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me or hears from me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, a thorn in the flesh was given to me: a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He has said to me, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">My</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">grace</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">sufficient</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">my</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">power</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">made</span> perfect <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">in</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">weakness</span>.”</span> Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Even so, I myself didn’t burden you. But you might say that being crafty, I caught you with deception.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Did I take advantage of you by anyone of those whom I have sent to you?</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit? Didn’t we walk in the same steps?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> For I am afraid that perhaps when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don’t desire, that perhaps there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, or riots,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness, sexual immorality, and lustfulness which they committed.</div>
