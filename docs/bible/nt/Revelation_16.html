<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and painful sore on the people who had the mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I heard the angel of the waters saying, “You are righteous, who are and who were, O Holy One, because you have judged these things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve this.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I heard the altar saying, “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> People were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn’t repent and give him glory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores. They still didn’t repent of their works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of that great day of God the Almighty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
