<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> as newborn babies, long for the pure spiritual milk, that with it you may grow,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Come to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> You also as living stones are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Because it is contained in Scripture,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen and precious.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He who believes in him will not be disappointed.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“The stone which the builders rejected<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>has become the chief cornerstone,”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> and,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“a stumbling stone and a rock of offense.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> In the past, you were not a people, but now are God’s people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Live as free people, yet not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> an example, that you should follow his steps,</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> who didn’t sin, “neither was deceit found in his mouth.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> When he was cursed, he didn’t curse back. When he suffered, he didn’t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness. You were healed by his wounds.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> For you were going astray like sheep; but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> of your souls.</div>
