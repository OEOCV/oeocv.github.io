<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate, but rather giving of thanks.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man (who is an idolater), has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore don’t be partakers with them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Have no fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For it is a shame even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Therefore he says, “Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Therefore, don’t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Don’t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly and gave himself up for her,</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without defect.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly,</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> “For this cause a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife. Then the two will become one flesh.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and the assembly.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</div>
