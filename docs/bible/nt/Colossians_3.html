<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For these things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> You also once walked in those, when you lived in them,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> but now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Don’t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, or free person; but Christ is all, and in all.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and be thankful.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be bitter against them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Fathers, don’t provoke your children, so that they won’t be discouraged.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.</div>
