<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members?</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”?</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Don’t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow let’s go into this city and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Yet you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> To him therefore who knows to do good and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin.</div>
