<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> two men stood by them in white clothing,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> who also said, “You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you into the sky, will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> When they had come in, they went up into the upper room where they were staying, that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> In these days, Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> “Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For he was counted with us, and received his portion in this ministry.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness; and falling headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines gushed out.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ‘Akeldama,’ that is, ‘The field of blood.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> For it is written in the book of Psalms,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Let his habitation be made desolate.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let no one dwell in it;’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Let another take his office.’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> beginning from the baptism of John to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> They put forward two: Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> They prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was counted with the eleven apostles.</div>
