<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But I would have you know that the head<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of every man is Christ, and the head<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> of the woman is man, and the head<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> of Christ is God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For man is not from woman, but woman from man;</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> for man wasn’t created for the woman, but woman for the man.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God’s assemblies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But in giving you this command I don’t praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> What, don’t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly and put them to shame who don’t have enough? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don’t praise you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“Take, eat. <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">This</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">my</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">body</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">which</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">broken</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span>. <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Do</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">this</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">in</span> memory <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">of</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">me</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> In the same way he also took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">This</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">cup</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">the</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">new</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">covenant</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">in</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">my</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">blood</span>. <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Do</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">this</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">as</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">often</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">as</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">drink</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">in</span> memory <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">of</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">me</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself if he doesn’t discern the Lord’s body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn’t be judged.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.</div>
