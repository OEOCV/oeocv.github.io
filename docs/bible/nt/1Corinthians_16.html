<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> On the first day of every week, let each one of you save as he may prosper, that no collections are made when I come.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But with you it may be that I will stay with you, or even winter with you, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Now concerning Apollos the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Let all that you do be done in love.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Now I beg you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints—</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Come, Lord!<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</div>
