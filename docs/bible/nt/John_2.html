<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or three metretes<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> apiece.</div>

<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!”</div>

<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> But he spoke of the temple of his body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But Jesus didn’t entrust himself to them, because he knew everyone,</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> and because he didn’t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</div>
