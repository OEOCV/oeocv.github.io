<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to anything, but faith working through love.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.</div>
