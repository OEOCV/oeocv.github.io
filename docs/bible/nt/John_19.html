<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> So Pilate then took Jesus and flogged him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> They kept saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and they kept slapping him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, “Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, “Behold, the man!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Pilate therefore said to him, “Aren’t you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you and have power to crucify you?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Jesus answered, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">You</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">would</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">have</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">no</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">power</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">at</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">all</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">against</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">me</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">unless</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">it</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">were</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">given</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">from</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">above</span>. <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Therefore</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">he</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">who</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">delivered</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">me</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">has</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">greater</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">sin</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you aren’t Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement”, but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> They cried out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called “The Place of a Skull”, which is called in Hebrew, “Golgotha”,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘he said, “I am King of the Jews.”’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Then they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“They parted my garments among them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They cast lots for my clothing.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore the soldiers did these things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> But standing by Jesus’|strong="G2424" cross were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Woman</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">behold</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">your</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">son</span>!” </span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Then he said to the disciple, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Behold</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">your</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">mother</span>!”</span> From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> After this, Jesus, seeing<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">I</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">am</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">thirsty</span>!”</span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">It</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">finished</span>!”</span> Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn’t remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him;</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they didn’t break his legs.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him will not be broken.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Again another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they pierced.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus’|strong="G2424" body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> So they took Jesus’|strong="G2424" body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> Then, because of the Jews’ Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand), they laid Jesus there.</div>
