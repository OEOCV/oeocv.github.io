<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The high priest said, “Are these things so?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He said, “Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and said to him, ‘Get out of your land and away from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land where you are now living.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his offspring after him, when he still had no child.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> God spoke in this way: that his offspring would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> ‘I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out and serve me in this place.’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> “The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family was revealed to Pharaoh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Jacob went down into Egypt and he died, himself and our fathers;</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> and they were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> “But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> until there arose a different king who didn’t know Joseph.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The same took advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to abandon their babies, so that they wouldn’t stay alive.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome to God. He was nourished three months in his father’s house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> When he was abandoned, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up and reared him as her own son.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> the children of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> He supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they didn’t understand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> “The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, ‘Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?’</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> “When forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, the voice of the Lord came to him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> ‘I am the God of your fathers: the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Moses trembled and dared not look.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> The Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you stand is holy ground.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Egypt.’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> “This Moses whom they refused, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’—God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> This man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, ‘The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me.’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup><sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living revelations to give to us,</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> to whom our fathers wouldn’t be obedient, but rejected him and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> saying to Aaron, ‘Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> They made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> But God turned away and gave them up to serve the army of the sky,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> as it is written in the book of the prophets,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Did you offer to me slain animals and sacrifices<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> You took up the tabernacle of Moloch,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the star of your god Rephan,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the figures which you made to worship,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so I will carry you away<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> beyond Babylon.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> “Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen;</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations whom God drove out before the face of our fathers to the days of David,</div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> But Solomon built him a house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> However, the Most High doesn’t dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> ‘heaven is my throne,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the earth a footstool for my feet.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>What kind of house will you build me?’ says the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Or what is the place of my rest?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> Didn’t my hand make all these things?’<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> “You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did, so you do.</div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> Which of the prophets didn’t your fathers persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> You received the law as it was ordained by angels, and didn’t keep it!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v54"><span class="vn">54</span> Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v55"><span class="vn">55</span> But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</div>
<div class="v" id="v56"><span class="vn">56</span> and said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v57"><span class="vn">57</span> But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears, then rushed at him with one accord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v58"><span class="vn">58</span> They threw him out of the city and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.</div>
<div class="v" id="v59"><span class="vn">59</span> They stoned Stephen as he called out, saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v60"><span class="vn">60</span> He kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, “Lord, don’t hold this sin against them!” When he had said this, he fell asleep.</div>
