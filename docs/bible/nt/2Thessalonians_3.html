<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and into the perseverance of Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion and not after the tradition which they received from us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For you know how you ought to imitate us. For we didn’t behave ourselves rebelliously among you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> neither did we eat bread from anyone’s hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> This was not because we don’t have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: “If anyone is not willing to work, don’t let him eat.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don’t work at all, but are busybodies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness and eat their own bread.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But you, brothers, don’t be weary in doing what is right.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> If any man doesn’t obey our word in this letter, note that man and have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Don’t count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter. This is how I write.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</div>
