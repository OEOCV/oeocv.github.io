<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, you aren’t ready even now,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave to him?</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool that he may become wise.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</div>
