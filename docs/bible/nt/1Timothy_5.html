<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Honor widows who are widows indeed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety toward their own family and to repay their parents, for this is<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> acceptable in the sight of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Now she who is a widow indeed and desolate, has her hope set on God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But if anyone doesn’t provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints’|strong="G40" feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For already some have turned away after Satan.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don’t let the assembly be burdened, that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> And, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">The</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">laborer</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">worthy</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">of</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">his</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">wages</span>.”</span><sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Don’t receive an accusation against an elder except at the word of two or three witnesses.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> I command you in the sight of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Lay hands hastily on no one. Don’t be a participant in other people’s sins. Keep yourself pure.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden.</div>
