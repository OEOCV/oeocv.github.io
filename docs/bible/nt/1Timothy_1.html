<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>Paul’s First Letter to Timothy</h2><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> our hope,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But the goal of this command is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned away to vain talking,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say nor about what they strongly affirm.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But we know that the law is good if a person uses it lawfully,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> although I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may wage the good warfare,</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> holding faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</div>
