<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing and say, “Sit here in a good place;” and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool”</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you and personally drag you before the courts?</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> However, if you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> you do well.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> also said, “Do not commit murder.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Now if you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> So speak and so do as men who are to be judged by the law of freedom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> and one of you tells them, “Go in peace. Be warmed and filled;” yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it?</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe—and shudder.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness,”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> and he was called the friend of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> You see then that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</div>
