<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For each man will bear his own burden.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season if we don’t give up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</div>
