<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> You know that when you were heathen,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> There are various kinds of workings, but the same God who works all things in all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and to another workings of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of languages, and to another the interpretation of languages.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For the body is not one member, but many.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> If they were all one member, where would the body be?</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> But now they are many members, but one body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant modesty,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> while our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.</div>
