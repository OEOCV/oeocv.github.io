<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of David, according to my Good News,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> This saying is trustworthy:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“For if we died with him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>we will also live with him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> If we endure,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>we will also reign with him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>If we deny him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he also will deny us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> If we are faithless,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he remains faithful;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he can’t deny himself.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus:</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> depart from unrighteousness.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for dishonor.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient,</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will.</div>
