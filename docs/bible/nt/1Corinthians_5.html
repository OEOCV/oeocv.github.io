<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> You are arrogant, and didn’t mourn instead, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together with my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> you are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore let’s keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters, for then you would have to leave the world.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within?</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
