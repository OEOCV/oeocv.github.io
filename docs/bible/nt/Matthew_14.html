<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> His head was brought on a platter and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> His disciples came, took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them and healed their sick.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> But Jesus said to them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">They</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">don’t</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">need</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">go</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">away</span>. <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">You</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">give</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">them</span> something <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">eat</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> He said, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Bring</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">them</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">here</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">me</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> They all ate and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> In the fourth watch of the night,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“Cheer up! <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">It</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">I</span>! </span><sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus"><span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Don’t</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">be</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">afraid</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> He said, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Come</span>!”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">You</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">of</span> little faith, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">why</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">did</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> doubt?”</span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the Son of God!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick;</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.</div>
