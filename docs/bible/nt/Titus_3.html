<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior;</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Grace be with you all. Amen.</div>
