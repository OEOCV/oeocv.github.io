<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He departed there and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Don’t</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">be</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">afraid</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">but</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">speak</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">and</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">don’t</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">be</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">silent</span>; </span></div>

<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> saying, “This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don’t want to be a judge of these matters.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> So he drove them from the judgment seat.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn’t care about any of these things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> but taking his leave of them, he said, “I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Having spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him; and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</div>
