<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>Paul’s Letter to Philemon</h2><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Christ<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</div>
