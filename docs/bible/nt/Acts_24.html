<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that prosperity is coming to this nation by your foresight,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, “Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> seeing that you can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> In the temple they didn’t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> In this I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> They ought to have been here before you and to make accusation if they had anything against me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> After some days, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, “Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often and talked with him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</div>
