<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, we ask you</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> not to be quickly shaken in your mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter as if from us, saying that the day of Christ has already come.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not be unless the rebellion<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> He opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Don’t you remember that when I was still with you, I told you these things?</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For the mystery of lawlessness already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didn’t receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Because of this, God sends them a powerful delusion, that they should believe a lie,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> that they all might be judged who didn’t believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> So then, brothers, stand firm and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word or by letter.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.</div>
