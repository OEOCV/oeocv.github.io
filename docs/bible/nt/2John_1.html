<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>John’s Second Letter</h2><span class="vn">1</span> The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</div>
