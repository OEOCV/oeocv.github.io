<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Be diligent to come to me soon,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</div>
