<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed:</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily; not for dishonest gain, but willingly;</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> not as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility and subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you. So does Mark, my son.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Greet one another with a kiss of love.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</div>
