<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> that your faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown, yet a wisdom not of this world nor of the rulers of this world who are coming to nothing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> But as it is written,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Things which an eye didn’t see, and an ear didn’t hear,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>which didn’t enter into the heart of man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>these God has prepared for those who love him.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God except God’s Spirit.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But we received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> We also speak these things, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him; and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is to be judged by no one.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> “For who has known the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him?” <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> But we have Christ’s mind.</div>
