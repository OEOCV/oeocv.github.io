<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Follow after love and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God, for no one understands, but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but even more that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But now, brothers,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Even lifeless things that make a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they didn’t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> If then I don’t know the meaning of the language, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> What should I do? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the “Amen” at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn’t know what you say?</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> However, in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Brothers, don’t be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> In the law it is written, “By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. They won’t even listen to me that way, says the Lord.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won’t they say that you are crazy?</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, or has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> If any man speaks in another language, let there be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Let two or three of the prophets speak, and let the others discern.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Let the wives be quiet in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to be talking except in submission, as the law also says,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> if they desire to learn anything. “Let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a wife to be talking in the assembly.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> What!? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> If any man thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don’t forbid speaking with other languages.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> Let all things be done decently and in order.</div>
