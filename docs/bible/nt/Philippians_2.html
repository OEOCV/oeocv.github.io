<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> If therefore there is any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> make my joy full by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> who, existing in the form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, yes, the death of the cross.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Do all things without complaining and arguing,</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without defect in the middle of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> holding up the word of life, that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ that I didn’t run in vain nor labor in vain.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> In the same way, you also should be glad and rejoice with me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But you know that he has proved himself. As a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need,</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> since he longed for you all, and was very troubled because you had heard that he was sick.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> For indeed he was sick nearly to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such people in honor,</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</div>
