<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> They went out and preached that people should repent.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick and healed them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> But Herod, when he heard this, said, “This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For John had said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Herodias set herself against him and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Then a convenient day came when Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> He swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> She came in immediately with haste to the king and requested, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring John’s head; and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> He said to them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Come</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">away</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">into</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">a</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">deserted</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">place</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">and</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">rest</span> awhile.”</span> For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> They<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> But he answered them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">You</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">give</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">them</span> something <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">eat</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> worth of bread and give them something to eat?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> He said to them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">How</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">many</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">loaves</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">do</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">have</span>? <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Go</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">see</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> He took the five loaves and the two fish; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> They all ate and were filled.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> Those who ate the loaves were<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> five thousand men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.</div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land.</div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea; <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> and he would have passed by them,</div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;</div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> for they all saw him and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them and said to them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“Cheer up! <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">It</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">I</span>!</span><sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus"><span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Don’t</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">be</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">afraid</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;</div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.</div>
<div class="v" id="v54"><span class="vn">54</span> When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v55"><span class="vn">55</span> and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick on their mats to where they heard he was.</div>
<div class="v" id="v56"><span class="vn">56</span> Wherever he entered—into villages, or into cities, or into the country—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might just touch the fringe<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.</div>
