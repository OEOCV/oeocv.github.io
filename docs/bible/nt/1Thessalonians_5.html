<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman. Then they will in no way escape.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> You are all children of light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But since we belong to the day, let’s be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Be at peace among yourselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> We exhort you, brothers: Admonish the disorderly; encourage the faint-hearted; support the weak; be patient toward all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Always rejoice.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Pray without ceasing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Don’t quench the Spirit.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Don’t despise prophecies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Abstain from every form of evil.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Brothers, pray for us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</div>
