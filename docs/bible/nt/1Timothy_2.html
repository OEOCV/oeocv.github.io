<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for all men,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> for kings and all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> but with good works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.</div>

Thus “μη” in this context is denying an expected idea (that women can be properly dressed without good works).</span></div>
