<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>make the way of the Lord ready!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Make his paths straight!”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance!</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> to John, to be baptized by him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But Jesus, answering, said to him, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Allow</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">it</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">now</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">this</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">is</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">the</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">fitting</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">way</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">us</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">fulfill</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">all</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">righteousness</span>.”</span> Then he allowed him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”</div>
