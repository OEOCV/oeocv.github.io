<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> They bound him, led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them to bury strangers in.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore that field has been called “The Field of Blood” to this day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> the prophet was fulfilled, saying,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“They took the thirty pieces of silver,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the price of him upon whom a price had been set,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>whom some of the children of Israel priced,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and they gave them for the potter’s field,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as the Lord commanded me.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">So</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">say</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they desired.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> They had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They said, “Barabbas!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> All the people answered, “May his blood be on us and on our children!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,”</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> they gave him sour wine<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> to drink mixed with gall.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> When he had tasted it, he would not drink.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> and they sat and watched him there.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> and saying, “You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> Likewise the chief priests also mocking with the scribes, the Pharisees,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> and the elders, said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> “He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> Now from the sixth hour<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Eli</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Eli</span>, lima</span><sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus"><span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">sabachthani</span>?” </span> That is, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">My</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">God</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">my</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">God</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">why</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">have</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">forsaken</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">me</span>?”</span><sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.</div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.</div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;</div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v54"><span class="vn">54</span> Now the centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were done, were terrified, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v55"><span class="vn">55</span> Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v56"><span class="vn">56</span> Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v57"><span class="vn">57</span> When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’|strong="G2424" disciple, came.</div>
<div class="v" id="v58"><span class="vn">58</span> This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’|strong="G2424" body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v59"><span class="vn">59</span> Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth</div>
<div class="v" id="v60"><span class="vn">60</span> and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v61"><span class="vn">61</span> Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v62"><span class="vn">62</span> Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,</div>
<div class="v" id="v63"><span class="vn">63</span> saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v64"><span class="vn">64</span> Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v65"><span class="vn">65</span> Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v66"><span class="vn">66</span> So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.</div>
