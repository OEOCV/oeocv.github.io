<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He answered, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">So</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">say</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> The chief priests accused him of many things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomever they asked of him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> They cried out again, “Crucify him!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> They clothed him with purple; and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> When they had mocked him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> It was the third hour<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> when they crucified him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> The superscription of his accusation was written over him: “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> With him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> The Scripture was fulfilled which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> save yourself, and come down from the cross!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> When the sixth hour<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Eloi</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Eloi</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">lama</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">sabachthani</span>?”</span> which is, being interpreted, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">My</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">God</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">my</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">God</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">why</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">have</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">forsaken</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">me</span>?”</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’|strong="G2424" body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</div>
