<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> of which I was made a servant according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> and to make all men see what is the administration<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> according to the eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> In him we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth,</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</div>
