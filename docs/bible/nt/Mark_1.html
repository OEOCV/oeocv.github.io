<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> I baptized you in<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.</div>

<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Jesus said to them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Come</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">after</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">me</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">and</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">I</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">will</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">make</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">into</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">fishers</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">men</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Be</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">quiet</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">and</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">come</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">out</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">of</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">him</span>!” </span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> He came and took her by the hand and raised her up. The fever left her immediately,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> and she served them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> All the city was gathered together at the door.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> Simon and those who were with him searched for him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> They found him and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> He said to them, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“Let’s <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">go</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">elsewhere</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">into</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">the</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">next</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">towns</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">that</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">I</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">may</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">preach</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">there</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">also</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">because</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">I</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">came</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">out</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">this</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">reason</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">I</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">want</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span>. <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Be</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">made</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">clean</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> He strictly warned him and immediately sent him out,</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> and said to him, <span class="fmt-words-of-jesus">“<span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">See</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">that</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">you</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">say</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">nothing</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> anybody, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">but</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">go</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">show</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">yourself</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">the</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">priest</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">and</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">offer</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">your</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">cleansing</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">the</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">things</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">which</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Moses</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">commanded</span>, <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">for</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">a</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">testimony</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">to</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">them</span>.”</span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People came to him from everywhere.</div>
