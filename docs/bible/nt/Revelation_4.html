<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven; and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, “Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The first creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, “Holy, holy, holy<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed and were created!”</div>
