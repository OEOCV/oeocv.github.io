<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>Paul’s Letter to the Philippians</h2><span class="vn">1</span> Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> and servants:<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I thank my God whenever I remember you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> always in every request of mine on behalf of you all, making my requests with joy,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> for your partnership<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> so that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Now I desire to have you know, brothers,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> so that it became evident to the whole palace<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> For I know that this will turn out to my salvation through your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don’t know what I will choose.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> But I am hard pressed between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Yet to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> that your boasting<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.</div>
