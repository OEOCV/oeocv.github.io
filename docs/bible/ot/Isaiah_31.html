<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and rely on horses,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and trust in chariots because they are many,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in horsemen because they are very strong,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they don’t seek Yahweh!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and against the help of those who work iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their horses flesh, and not spirit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>When Yahweh stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he who is helped shall fall,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they all shall be consumed together.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For Yahweh says to me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>will not be dismayed at their voice,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor abase himself for their noise,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so Yahweh of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will protect and deliver it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will pass over and preserve it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold—sin which your own hands have made for you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will flee from the sword,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and his young men will become subject to forced labor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> His rock will pass away by reason of terror,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and his princes will be afraid of the banner,”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and his furnace in Jerusalem.</div>
