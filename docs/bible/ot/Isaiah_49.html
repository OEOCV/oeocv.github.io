<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Listen, islands, to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Listen, you peoples, from afar:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yahweh has called me from the womb;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>from the inside of my mother, he has mentioned my name.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He has made my mouth like a sharp sword.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has made me a polished shaft.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has kept me close in his quiver.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> He said to me, “You are my servant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But I said, “I have labored in vain.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have spent my strength in vain for nothing;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet surely the justice due to me is with Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and my reward with my God.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Now Yahweh, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>says to bring Jacob again to him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and to gather Israel to him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I am honorable in Yahweh’s eyes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and my God has become my strength.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Indeed, he says, “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and to restore the preserved of Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will also give you as a light to the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Kings shall see and rise up,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>princes, and they shall worship,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because of Yahweh who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Yahweh says, “I have answered you in an acceptable time.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have helped you in a day of salvation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will preserve you and give you for a covenant of the people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> saying to those who are bound, ‘Come out!’;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“They shall feed along the paths,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their pasture shall be on all treeless heights.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> The children of your bereavement will say in your ears,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘This place is too small for me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Give me a place to live in.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and am alone, an exile, and wandering back and forth?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Who has brought these up?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Behold, I was left alone. Where were these?’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> The Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and lift up my banner to the peoples.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They shall bring your sons in their bosom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
