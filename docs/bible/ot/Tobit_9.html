<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> And Tobias called Raphael, and said to him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> â€œBrother Azarias, take with you a servant and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and receive the money for me, and bring him to the wedding feast,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> because Raguel has sworn that I must not depart.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> My father counts the days; and if I wait long, he will be very grieved.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> So Raphael went on his way, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting; so he brought forth the bags with their seals, and gave them to him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Then they rose up early in the morning together, and came to the wedding feast. Tobias blessed his wife.</div>
