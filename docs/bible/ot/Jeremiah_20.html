<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in Yahweh’s house, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in Yahweh’s house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will see it. I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon, and will kill them with the sword.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, I will give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. They will make them captives, take them, and carry them to Babylon.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity. You will come to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You are stronger than I, and have prevailed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have become a laughingstock all day.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Everyone mocks me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For as often as I speak, I cry out;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I cry, “Violence and destruction!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because Yahweh’s word has been made a reproach to me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a derision, all day.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> If I say that I will not make mention of him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or speak any more in his name,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I am weary with holding it in.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I can’t.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For I have heard the defaming of many:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Terror on every side!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Denounce, and we will denounce him!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>say all my familiar friends,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>those who watch for my fall.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Perhaps he will be persuaded,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and we will prevail against him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and we will take our revenge on him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore my persecutors will stumble,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they won’t prevail.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will be utterly disappointed<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because they have not dealt wisely,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even with an everlasting dishonor which will never be forgotten.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who sees the heart and the mind,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>let me see your vengeance on them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I have revealed my cause to you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Sing to Yahweh!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Praise Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Cursed is the day in which I was born.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“A boy is born to you,” making him very glad.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and didn’t repent.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let him hear a cry in the morning,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and shouting at noontime,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> because he didn’t kill me from the womb.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>So my mother would have been my grave,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and her womb always great.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that my days should be consumed with shame?</div>
