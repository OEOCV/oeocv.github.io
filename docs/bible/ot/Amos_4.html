<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold, the days shall come on you that they will take you away with hooks,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the last of you with fish hooks.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> You will go out at the breaks in the wall,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>everyone straight before her;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you will cast yourselves into Harmon,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> “Go to Bethel, and sin;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to Gilgal, and sin more.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Bring your sacrifices every morning,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>your tithes every three days,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and proclaim free will offerings and brag about them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for this pleases you, you children of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and lack of bread in every town;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> “I also have withheld the rain from you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when there were yet three months to the harvest;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I caused it to rain on one city,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and caused it not to rain on another city.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>One field was rained on,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the field where it didn’t rain withered.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> So two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and were not satisfied;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “I sent plagues among you like I did Egypt.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have slain your young men with the sword,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and have carried away your horses.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camp,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “I have overthrown some of you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
