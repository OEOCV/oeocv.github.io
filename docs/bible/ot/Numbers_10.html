<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation and for the journeying of the camps.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</div>

<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets.

<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God.
