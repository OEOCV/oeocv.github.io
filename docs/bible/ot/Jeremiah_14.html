<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> This is Yahweh’s word that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Judah mourns,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and its gates languish.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They sit in black on the ground.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The cry of Jerusalem goes up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Their nobles send their little ones to the waters.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They come to the cisterns,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and find no water.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They return with their vessels empty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are disappointed and confounded,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cover their heads.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Because of the ground which is cracked,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because no rain has been in the land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the plowmen are disappointed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They cover their heads.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Yes, the doe in the field also calves and forsakes her young,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because there is no grass.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They pant for air like jackals.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their eyes fail,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because there is no vegetation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Though our iniquities testify against us,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>work for your name’s sake, Yahweh;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for our rebellions are many.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We have sinned against you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> You hope of Israel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>its Savior in the time of trouble,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>why should you be as a foreigner in the land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Why should you be like a scared man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as a mighty man who can’t save?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yet you, Yahweh, are in the middle of us,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and we are called by your name.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t leave us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Yahweh says to this people:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Even so they have loved to wander.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They have not restrained their feet.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore Yahweh does not accept them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Now he will remember their iniquity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and punish them for their sins.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Yahweh said to me, “Don’t pray for this people for their good.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Behold, the prophets tell them, ‘You will not see the sword, neither will you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Then Yahweh said to me, “The prophets prophesy lies in my name. I didn’t send them. I didn’t command them. I didn’t speak to them. They prophesy to you a lying vision, divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Therefore Yahweh says concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, but I didn’t send them, yet they say, ‘Sword and famine will not be in this land.’ Those prophets will be consumed by sword and famine.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> The people to whom they prophesy will be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. They will have no one to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters, for I will pour their wickedness on them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> “You shall say this word to them:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and let them not cease;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>with a very grievous wound.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> If I go out into the field,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>then behold, the slain with the sword!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>If I enter into the city,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>then behold, those who are sick with famine!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For both the prophet and the priest go about in the land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and have no knowledge.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Have you utterly rejected Judah?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Has your soul loathed Zion?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We looked for peace, but no good came;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the iniquity of our fathers;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for we have sinned against you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Do not abhor us, for your name’s sake.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Do not disgrace the throne of your glory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Remember, and don’t break your covenant with us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or can the sky give showers?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Aren’t you he, Yahweh our God?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore we will wait for you;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for you have made all these things.</div>
