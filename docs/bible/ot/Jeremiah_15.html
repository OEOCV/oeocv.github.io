<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> You have rejected me,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“You have gone backward.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore I have stretched out my hand against you<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and destroyed you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I am weary of showing compassion.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have bereaved them of children.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have destroyed my people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They didn’t return from their ways.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Their widows are increased more than the sand of the seas.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
