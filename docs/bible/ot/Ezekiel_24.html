<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Put the cauldron on the fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Put it on,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and also pour water into it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Gather its pieces into it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even every good piece:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the thigh and the shoulder.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Fill it with the choice bones.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Take the choice of the flock,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Make it boil well.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, let its bones be boiled within it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Woe to the bloody city,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to the cauldron whose rust is in it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Take out of it piece after piece<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>without casting lots for it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> “‘“For the blood she shed is in the middle of her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She set it on the bare rock.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She didn’t pour it on the ground,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to cover it with dust.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have set her blood on the bare rock,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that it should not be covered.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Woe to the bloody city!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I also will make the pile great.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Heap on the wood.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Make the fire hot.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Boil the meat well.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Make the broth thick,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and let the bones be burned.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Then set it empty on its coals,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that it may be hot,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and its bronze may burn,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and that its filthiness may be molten in it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that its rust may be consumed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> She is weary with toil;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet her great rust,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>rust by fire, doesn’t leave her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “‘“In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> “‘“I, Yahweh, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According to your ways and according to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Also Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> “Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things mean to us, that you act like this?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Then I said to them, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> ‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.’”’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> “You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart—their sons and their daughters—</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak and be no more mute. So you will be a sign to them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”</div>
