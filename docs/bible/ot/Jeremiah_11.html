<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and say to them, Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Cursed is the man who doesn’t hear the words of this covenant,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace,’ saying, ‘Obey my voice and do them, according to all which I command you; so you shall be my people, and I will be your God;</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as it is today.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Then I answered, and said, “Amen, Yahweh.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, “Obey my voice.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Yet they didn’t obey, nor turn their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart. Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn’t do them.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on them which they will not be able to escape; and they will cry to me, but I will not listen to them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> “Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> What has my beloved to do in my house,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>since she has behaved lewdly with many,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the holy flesh has passed from you?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>When you do evil,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>then you rejoice.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Yahweh called your name, “A green olive tree,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>beautiful with goodly fruit.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>With the noise of a great roar he has kindled fire on it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and its branches are broken.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it. Then you showed me their doings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plans against me, saying,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and let’s cut him off from the land of the living,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that his name may be no more remembered.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who tests the heart and the mind,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will see your vengeance on them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for to you I have revealed my cause.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “Therefore Yahweh says concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, ‘You shall not prophesy in Yahweh’s name, that you not die by our hand’—</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> therefore Yahweh of Armies says, ‘Behold, I will punish them. The young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by famine.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> There will be no remnant to them, for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.’”</div>
