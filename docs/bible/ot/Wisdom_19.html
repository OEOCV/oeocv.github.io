<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> But indignation without mercy came upon the ungodly to the end;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for God also foreknew their future,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> how, having changed their minds to let your people go,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and having sped them eagerly on their way,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they would change their minds and pursue them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For while they were yet in the midst of their mourning,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and lamenting at the graves of the dead,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they made another foolish decision,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and pursued as fugitives those whom they had begged to leave and driven out.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For the doom which they deserved was drawing them to this end,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and it made them forget the things that had happened to them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that they might fill up the punishment which was yet lacking from their torments,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> and that your people might journey on by a marvelous road,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but they themselves might find a strange death.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For the whole creation, each part in its diverse kind, was made new again,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>complying with your commandments,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that your servants might be kept unharmed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Then the cloud that overshadowed the camp was seen,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and dry land rising up out of what had been water,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>out of the Red sea an unhindered highway,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a grassy plain out of the violent surge,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> by which they passed over with all their army,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>these who were covered with your hand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>having seen strange marvels.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For like horses they roamed at large,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they skipped about like lambs,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>praising you, O Lord, who was their deliverer.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For they still remembered the things that happened in the time of their sojourning,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>how instead of bearing cattle, the land brought forth lice,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and instead of fish, the river spewed out a multitude of frogs.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But afterwards, they also saw a new kind of birds,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when, led on by desire, they asked for luxurious dainties;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> for, to comfort them, quails came up for them from the sea.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Punishments came upon the sinners,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>not without the signs that were given beforehand by the violence of the thunder,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they justly suffered through their own wickednesses,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the hatred which they practiced toward guests was grievous indeed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For while the others didn’t receive the strangers when they came to them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the Egyptians made slaves of guests who were their benefactors.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> And not only so, but while punishment of some sort will come upon the former,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>since they received as enemies those who were aliens;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> because these first welcomed with feastings,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and then afflicted with dreadful toils,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>those who had already shared with them in the same rights.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> And moreover they were stricken with loss of sight<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>(even as were those others at the righteous man’s doors),<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when, being surrounded with yawning darkness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they each looked for the passage through his own door.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For as the notes of a lute vary the character of the rhythm,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even so the elements, changing their order one with another,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>continuing always in its sound,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as may clearly be conjectured from the sight of the things that have happened.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> For creatures of the dry land were turned into creatures of the waters,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and creatures that swim moved upon the land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Fire kept the mastery of its own power in water,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and water forgot its quenching nature.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> On the contrary, flames didn’t consume flesh of perishable creatures that walked among them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither did they melt the crystalline grains of ambrosial food that were melted easily.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> For in all things, O Lord, you magnified your people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you glorified them and didn’t lightly regard them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>standing by their side in every time and place.</div>
