<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> The threshing floor and the wine press won’t feed them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the new wine will fail her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but Ephraim will return to Egypt,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> They won’t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither will they be pleasing to him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>all who eat of it will be polluted;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for their bread will be for their appetite.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It will not come into Yahweh’s house.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> What will you do in the day of solemn assembly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For, behold, when they flee destruction,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Egypt will gather them up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Memphis will bury them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Thorns will be in their tents.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The days of visitation have come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The days of reckoning have come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the man who is inspired to be insane,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because of the abundance of your sins,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and because your hostility is great.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and hostility in the house of his God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and became abominable like that which they loved.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There will be no birth, no one with child, and no conception.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Though they bring up their children,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Give them—Yahweh what will you give?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> “All their wickedness is in Gilgal;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for there I hated them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Because of the wickedness of their deeds, I will drive them out of my house!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will love them no more.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>All their princes are rebels.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Ephraim is struck.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their root has dried up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will bear no fruit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> My God will cast them away, because they didn’t listen to him;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will be wanderers among the nations.</div>
