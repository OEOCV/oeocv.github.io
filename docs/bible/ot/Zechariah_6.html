<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> In the first chariot were red horses. In the second chariot were black horses.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> In the third chariot were white horses. In the fourth chariot were dappled horses, all of them powerful.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out toward the south country.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth. He said, “Go around and through the earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> and speak to him, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “Behold, the man whose name is the Branch! He will grow up out of his place; and he will build Yahweh’s temple.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> He will build Yahweh’s temple. He will bear the glory, and will sit and rule on his throne. He will be a priest on his throne. The counsel of peace will be between them both.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> The crowns shall be to Helem, to Tobijah, to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in Yahweh’s temple.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Those who are far off shall come and build in Yahweh’s temple; and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you. This will happen, if you will diligently obey Yahweh your God’s voice.”’”<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
