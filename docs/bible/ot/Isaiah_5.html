<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He dug it up,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>gathered out its stones,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>planted it with the choicest vine,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>built a tower in the middle of it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and also cut out a wine press in it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He looked for it to yield grapes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but it yielded wild grapes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> “Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>please judge between me and my vineyard.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I will lay it a wasteland.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It won’t be pruned or hoed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but it will grow briers and thorns.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He looked for justice, but behold, oppression,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore Yahweh’s anger burns against his people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he has stretched out his hand against them and has struck them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The mountains tremble,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their dead bodies are as refuse in the middle of the streets.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For all this, his anger is not turned away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but his hand is still stretched out.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> He will lift up a banner to the nations from far away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
