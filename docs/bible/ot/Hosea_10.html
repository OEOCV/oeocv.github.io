<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>As their land has prospered, they have adorned their sacred stones.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Their heart is divided.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Now they will be found guilty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will demolish their altars.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will destroy their sacred stones.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Surely now they will say, “We have no king; for we don’t fear Yahweh;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the king, what can he do for us?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth Aven,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for its people will mourn over it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>along with its priests who rejoiced over it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for its glory, because it has departed from it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Ephraim will receive shame,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Samaria and her king float away<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>like a twig on the water.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will tell the mountains, “Cover us!” and the hills, “Fall on us!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> “Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There they remained.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The battle against the children of iniquity doesn’t overtake them in Gibeah.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> When it is my desire, I will chastise them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the nations will be gathered against them<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when they are bound to their two transgressions.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will set a rider on Ephraim.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Judah will plow.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Jacob will break his clods.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Sow to yourselves in righteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>reap according to kindness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Break up your fallow ground,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for it is time to seek Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>until he comes and rains righteousness on you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> You have plowed wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You have reaped iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You have eaten the fruit of lies,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Therefore a battle roar will arise among your people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all your fortresses will be destroyed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The mother was dashed in pieces with her children.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> So Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>At daybreak the king of Israel will be destroyed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
