<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> When the holy city was inhabited with unbroken peace and the laws were kept very well because of the godliness of Onias the high priest and his hatred of wickedness,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> it came to pass that even the kings themselves honored the place and glorified the temple with the noblest presents,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> so that even King Seleucus of Asia bore all the costs belonging to the services of the sacrifices out of his own revenues.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But a man named Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, having been made guardian of the temple, disagreed with the high priest about the ruling of the market in the city.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> When he couldn’t overcome Onias, he went to Apollonius of <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>Tarsus, who at that time was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> He brought him word how that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of untold sums of money, so that the multitude of the funds was innumerable, and that they didn’t pertain to the account of the sacrifices, but that it was possible that these should fall under the king’s power.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> When Apollonius met the king, he informed him of the money about which he had been told. So the king appointed Heliodorus, who was his chancellor, and sent him with a command to accomplish the removal of the reported money.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> So Heliodorus set out on his journey at once, ostensibly to visit the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, but in fact to execute the king’s purpose.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> When he had come to Jerusalem and had been courteously received by the high priest of the city, he told him about the information which had been given, and declared why he had come; and he inquired if in truth these things were so.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> The high priest explained to him that there were in the treasury deposits of widows and orphans,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> and moreover some money belonging to Hyrcanus the son of Tobias, a man in very high place, not as that impious Simon falsely alleged; and that in all there were four hundred talents of silver and two hundred of gold,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> and that it was altogether impossible that wrong should be done to those who had put trust in the holiness of the place, and in the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honored over all the world.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But Heliodorus, because of the king’s command given him, said that in any case this money must be confiscated for the king’s treasury.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> So having appointed a day, he entered in to direct the inquiry concerning these matters; and there was no small distress throughout the whole city.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> The priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in their priestly garments, and called toward heaven upon him who gave the law concerning deposits, that he should preserve these treasures safe for those who had deposited them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Whoever saw the appearance of the high priest was wounded in mind; for his countenance and the change of his color betrayed the distress of his soul.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For a terror and a shuddering of the body had come over the man, by which the pain that was in his heart was plainly shown to those who looked at him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Those who were in the houses rushed out in crowds to make a universal supplication, because the place was about to come into dishonor.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The women, girded with sackcloth under their breasts, thronged the streets. The virgins who were kept indoors ran together, some to the gates, others to the walls, and some looked out through the windows.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> All, stretching out their hands toward heaven, made their solemn supplication.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Then it was pitiful to see the multitude prostrating themselves all mixed together, and the anxiety of the high priest in his great distress.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> While therefore they called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the things entrusted to them <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> safe and secure for those who had entrusted them,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Heliodorus went on to execute that which had been decreed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But when he was already present there with his guards near the treasury, the Sovereign of spirits and of all authority caused a great manifestation, so that all who had presumed to come with him, stricken with dismay at the power of God, fainted in terror.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> For they saw a horse with a frightening rider, adorned with beautiful trappings, and he rushed fiercely and struck at Heliodorus with his forefeet. It seemed like he who sat on the horse had complete armor of gold.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Two others also appeared to him, young men notable in their strength, and beautiful in their glory, and splendid in their apparel, who stood by him on either side, and scourged him unceasingly, inflicting on him many sore stripes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> When he had fallen suddenly to the ground, and great darkness had come over him, his guards picked him up and put him on a stretcher,</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> and carried him—this man who had just now entered with a great retinue and all his guard into the aforesaid treasury, himself now brought to utter helplessness, manifestly made to recognize the sovereignty of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> So, while he, through the working of God, speechless and bereft of all hope and deliverance, lay prostrate,</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> they blessed the Lord who acted marvelously for his own place. The temple, which a little before was full of terror and alarm, was filled with joy and gladness after the Almighty Lord appeared.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> But quickly some of Heliodorus’s familiar friends implored Onias to call upon the Most High to grant life to him who lay quite at the last gasp.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> The high priest, secretly fearing lest the king might come to think that some treachery toward Heliodorus had been perpetrated by the Jews, brought a sacrifice for the recovery of the man.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> But as the high priest was making the atoning sacrifice, the same young men appeared again to Heliodorus, arrayed in the same garments. They stood and said, “Give Onias the high priest great thanks, for for his sake the Lord has granted you life.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> See that you, since you have been scourged from heaven, proclaim to all men the sovereign majesty of God.” When they had spoken these words, they vanished out of sight.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> So Heliodorus, having offered a sacrifice to the Lord and vowed <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>great vows to him who had saved his life, and having bidden Onias farewell, returned with his army to the king.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> He testified to all men the works of the greatest God, which he had seen with his eyes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> When the king asked Heliodorus what sort of man was fit to be sent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> “If you have any enemy or conspirator against the state, send him there, and you will receive him back well scourged, if he even escapes with his life; because truly there is some power of God in that place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> For he who has his dwelling in heaven himself has his eyes on that place and helps it. Those who come to hurt it, he strikes and destroys.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> This was the history of Heliodorus and the keeping of the treasury.</div>
