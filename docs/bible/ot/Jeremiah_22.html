<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh said, “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak this word there:</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, king of Judah, who sits on David’s throne—you, your servants, and your people who enter in by these gates.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh says: “Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. Do no wrong. Do no violence to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Don’t shed innocent blood in this place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses—they, their servants, and their people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,” says Yahweh, “that this house will become a desolation.”’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For Yahweh says concerning the house of the king of Judah:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“You are Gilead to me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the head of Lebanon.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yet surely I will make you a wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>cities which are not inhabited.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I will prepare destroyers against you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>everyone with his weapons,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will cut down your choice cedars,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cast them into the fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “Many nations will pass by this city, and they will each ask his neighbor, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this great city?’</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, worshiped other gods, and served them.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Don’t weep for the dead.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t bemoan him;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but weep bitterly for him who goes away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he will return no more,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and not see his native country.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For Yahweh says touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went out of this place: “He won’t return there any more.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But he will die in the place where they have led him captive. He will see this land no more.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and his rooms by injustice;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who uses his neighbor’s service without wages,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and doesn’t give him his hire;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> who says, ‘I will build myself a wide house and spacious rooms,’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cuts out windows for himself,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>with a cedar ceiling,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and painted with red.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> “Should you reign because you strive to excel in cedar?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Didn’t your father eat and drink,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and do justice and righteousness?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Then it was well with him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> He judged the cause of the poor and needy;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so then it was well.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Wasn’t this to know me?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for shedding innocent blood,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for oppression, and for doing violence.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“They won’t lament for him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>saying, ‘Ah my brother!’ or, ‘Ah sister!’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They won’t lament for him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>saying ‘Ah lord!’ or, ‘Ah his glory!’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> He will be buried with the burial of a donkey,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>drawn and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> “Go up to Lebanon, and cry out.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Lift up your voice in Bashan,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cry from Abarim;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for all your lovers have been destroyed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> I spoke to you in your prosperity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but you said, ‘I will not listen.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>This has been your way from your youth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that you didn’t obey my voice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> The wind will feed all your shepherds,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your lovers will go into captivity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Surely then you will be ashamed<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and confounded for all your wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Inhabitant of Lebanon,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who makes your nest in the cedars,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come on you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the pain as of a woman in travail!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> “As I live,” says Yahweh, “though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, I would still pluck you from there.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> I would give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> I will cast you out with your mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born; and there you will die.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> But to the land to which their soul longs to return, there they will not return.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Is he a vessel in which no one delights?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Why are they cast out, he and his offspring,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cast into a land which they don’t know?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> O earth, earth, earth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>hear Yahweh’s word!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Yahweh says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Record this man as childless,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a man who will not prosper in his days;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for no more will a man of his offspring prosper,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>sitting on David’s throne<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and ruling in Judah.”</div>
