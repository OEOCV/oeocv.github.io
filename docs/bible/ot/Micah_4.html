<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> But in the latter days,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and it will be exalted above the hills;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and peoples will stream to it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Many nations will go and say,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and to the house of the God of Jacob;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he will teach us of his ways,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and we will walk in his paths.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For the law will go out of Zion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and he will judge between many peoples,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will beat their swords into plowshares,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their spears into pruning hooks.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Nation will not lift up sword against nation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither will they learn war any more.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>No one will make them afraid,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “In that day,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“I will assemble that which is lame,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will gather that which is driven away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and that which I have afflicted;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> and I will make that which was lame a remnant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and that which was cast far off a strong nation:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to you it will come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, the former dominion will come,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Now why do you cry out aloud?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Is there no king in you?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Has your counselor perished,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>like a woman in travail;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for now you will go out of the city,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will dwell in the field,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will come even to Babylon.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There you will be rescued.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Let her be defiled,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and let our eye gloat over Zion.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither do they understand his counsel;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I will make your horn iron,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will make your hoofs bronze.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You will beat in pieces many peoples.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will devote their gain to Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
