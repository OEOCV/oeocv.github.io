<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim. He fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. The name of the place was called Hormah.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, there is no water, and our soul loathes this disgusting food!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Yahweh sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people. Many people of Israel died.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us.” Moses prayed for the people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Make a venomous snake, and set it on a pole. It shall happen that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Moses made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the pole. If a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, he lived.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Therefore it is said in <span class="css" style="font-style: italic; -bmc-usfm-tag: bk;"><span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">The</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Book</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">of</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">the</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Wars</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">of</span> <span class="css" style="-bmc-usfm-tag: w;">Yahweh</span></span>, “Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> From there they traveled to Beer; that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Then Israel sang this song:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Spring up, well! Sing to it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> the well, which the princes dug,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>which the nobles of the people dug,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>with the scepter, and with their poles.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn away into field or vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed your border.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was fortified.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Come to Heshbon.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let the city of Sihon be built and established;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a flame from the city of Sihon.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It has devoured Ar of Moab,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The lords of the high places of the Arnon.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Woe to you, Moab!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You are undone, people of Chemosh!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has given his sons as fugitives,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and his daughters into captivity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to Sihon king of the Amorites.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> We have shot at them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We have laid waste even to Nophah,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Which reaches to Medeba.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the Amorites who were there.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Don’t fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land.</div>
