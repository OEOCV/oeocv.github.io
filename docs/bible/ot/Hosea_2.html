<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Contend with your mother!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Contend, for she is not my wife,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither am I her husband;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and let her put away her prostitution from her face,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and her adulteries from between her breasts;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> lest I strip her naked,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and make her bare as in the day that she was born,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and make her like a wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and set her like a dry land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and kill her with thirst.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they are children of unfaithfulness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For their mother has played the prostitute.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She who conceived them has done shamefully;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who give me my bread and my water,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>my wool and my flax,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>my oil and my drink.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> I will hedge up your way with thorns,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will build a wall against her,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that she can’t find her way.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> She will follow after her lovers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but she won’t overtake them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and she will seek them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but won’t find them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for then it was better with me than now.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and my new wine in its season,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and no one will deliver her out of my hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me,’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will make them a forest,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the animals of the field shall eat them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I will visit on her the days of the Baals,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to which she burned incense<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and went after her lovers<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and forgot me,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> I will give her vineyards from there,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and she will respond there<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as in the days of her youth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> It will be in that day,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“that you will call me ‘my husband,’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and no longer call me ‘my master.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will no longer be mentioned by name.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and with the birds of the sky,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and with the creeping things of the ground.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will make them lie down safely.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> I will betroth you to me forever.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you shall know Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> It will happen in that day, that I will respond,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“I will respond to the heavens,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will respond to the earth;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will respond to Jezreel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> I will sow her to me in the earth;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will say, ‘You are My God!’”</div>
