<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted, for his people Israel’s sake.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yahweh said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like waters breaking out. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> They left their gods there; and David gave a command, and they were burned with fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> The Philistines made a another raid in the valley.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> David inquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them opposite the mulberry trees.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> David did as God commanded him; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.</div>
