<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Behold, Yahweh’s hand is not shortened, that it can’t save;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor his ear dull, that it can’t hear.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> But your iniquities have separated you and your God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your sins have hidden his face from you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so that he will not hear.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For your hands are defiled with blood,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your fingers with iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Your lips have spoken lies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Your tongue mutters wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> No one sues in righteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and no one pleads in truth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They trust in vanity<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and speak lies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They conceive mischief<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and give birth to iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> They hatch adders’ eggs<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and weave the spider’s web.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He who eats of their eggs dies;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Their webs won’t become garments.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They won’t cover themselves with their works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their works are works of iniquity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and acts of violence are in their hands.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Their feet run to evil,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they hurry to shed innocent blood.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Desolation and destruction are in their paths.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> They don’t know the way of peace;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and there is no justice in their ways.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They have made crooked paths for themselves;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>whoever goes in them doesn’t know peace.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore justice is far from us,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and righteousness doesn’t overtake us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We look for light, but see darkness;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> We grope for the wall like the blind.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, we grope as those who have no eyes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We stumble at noon as if it were twilight.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Among those who are strong, we are like dead men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> We all roar like bears<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and moan sadly like doves.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We look for justice, but there is none,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for salvation, but it is far off from us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For our transgressions are multiplied before you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and our sins testify against us;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for our transgressions are with us,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and as for our iniquities, we know them:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> transgressing and denying Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and turning away from following our God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>speaking oppression and revolt,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Justice is turned away backward,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and righteousness stands far away;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for truth has fallen in the street,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and uprightness can’t enter.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Yes, truth is lacking;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yahweh saw it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and it displeased him that there was no justice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> He saw that there was no man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and wondered that there was no intercessor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and his righteousness sustained him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> He put on righteousness as a breastplate,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a helmet of salvation on his head.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He put on garments of vengeance for clothing,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and was clad with zeal as a mantle.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> According to their deeds,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he will repay as appropriate:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>wrath to his adversaries,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>recompense to his enemies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will repay the islands their due.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> So they will fear Yahweh’s name from the west,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and his glory from the rising of the sun;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he will come as a rushing stream,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>which Yahweh’s breath drives.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> “A Redeemer will come to Zion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says Yahweh. “My Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your offspring, nor out of the mouth of your offspring’s offspring,” says Yahweh, “from now on and forever.”</div>
