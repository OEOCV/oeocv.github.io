<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Then the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Then the herald cried aloud, “To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace the same hour.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, live for ever!</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image;</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> and whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not respected you. They don’t serve your gods, and don’t worship the golden image which you have set up.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. Then these men were brought before the king.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Nebuchadnezzar answered them, “Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, good; but if you don’t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. Who is that god who will deliver you out of my hands?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> If it happens, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, their mantles, and their other clothes, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><h6 class="depth-5">THE SONG OF THE THREE HOLY CHILDREN<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></h6><span class="vn">24</span> They walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Then Azarias stood, and prayed like this. Opening his mouth in the midst of the fire he said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> “Blessed are you, O Lord, you God of our fathers! Your name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore;</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> for you are righteous in all the things that you have done. Yes, all your works are true. Your ways are right, and all your judgments are truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> In all the things that you have brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, Jerusalem, you have executed true judgments. For according to truth and justice you have brought all these things upon us because of our sins.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> For we have sinned and committed iniquity in departing from you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> In all things we have trespassed, and not obeyed your commandments or kept them. We haven’t done as you have commanded us, that it might go well with us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Therefore all that you have brought upon us, and everything that you have done to us, you have done in true judgment.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> You delivered us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful rebels, and to an unjust king who is the most wicked in all the world.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> And now we can’t open our mouth. Shame and reproach have come on your servants and those who worship you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Don’t utterly deliver us up, for your name’s sake. Don’t annul your covenant.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> Don’t cause your mercy to depart from us, for the sake of Abraham who is loved by you, and for the sake of Isaac your servant, and Israel your holy one,</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> to whom you promised that you would multiply their offspring as the stars of the sky, and as the sand that is on the sea shore.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> For we, O Lord, have become less than any nation, and are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> There isn’t at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to offer before you, and to find mercy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> Nevertheless in a contrite heart and a humble spirit let us be accepted,</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> like the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like ten thousands of fat lambs. So let our sacrifice be in your sight this day, that we may wholly go after you, for they shall not be ashamed who put their trust in you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> And now we follow you with all our heart. We fear you, and seek your face.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> Put us not to shame; but deal with us after your kindness, and according to the multitude of your mercy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> Deliver us also according to your marvelous works, and give glory to your name, O Lord. Let all those who harm your servants be confounded.</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> Let them be ashamed of all their power and might, and let their strength be broken.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> Let them know that you are the Lord, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> The king’s servants who put them in didn’t stop making the furnace hot with naphtha, pitch, tinder, and small wood,</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> so that the flame streamed out forty nine cubits above the furnace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> It spread and burned those Chaldeans whom it found around the furnace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace together with Azarias and his fellows, and he struck the flame of the fire out of the furnace,</div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> and made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire didn’t touch them at all. It neither hurt nor troubled them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> “Blessed are you, O Lord, you God of our fathers, to be praised and exalted above all forever!</div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> Blessed is your glorious and holy name, to be praised and exalted above all forever!</div>

<div class="v" id="v91"><h6 class="depth-5">Deliverance from the Furnace</h6><span class="vn">91</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste. He spoke and said to his counselors, “Didn’t we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They answered the king, “True, O king.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v92"><span class="vn">92</span> He answered, “Look, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are unharmed. The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v93"><span class="vn">93</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire.</div>
<div class="v" id="v94"><span class="vn">94</span> The local governors, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies. The hair of their head wasn’t singed. Their pants weren’t changed. The smell of fire wasn’t even on them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v95"><span class="vn">95</span> Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v96"><span class="vn">96</span> Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, who speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v97"><span class="vn">97</span> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</div>
