<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Then I asked, “Where are you going?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For I,’ says Yahweh, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the middle of her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> ‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For Yahweh of Armies says: ‘For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a plunder to those who served them; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! For behold, I come and I will dwell within you,’ says Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell among you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!”</div>
