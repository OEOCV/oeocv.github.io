<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> There is no one as holy as Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for there is no one besides you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor is there any rock like our God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> “Don’t keep talking so exceedingly proudly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for Yahweh is a God of knowledge.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>By him actions are weighed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> “The bows of the mighty men are broken.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Those who stumbled are armed with strength.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “Yahweh kills and makes alive.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He brings down to Sheol<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and brings up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Yahweh makes poor and makes rich.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He brings low, he also lifts up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He raises up the poor out of the dust.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He lifts up the needy from the dunghill<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to make them sit with princes<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and inherit the throne of glory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh’s.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has set the world on them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He will keep the feet of his holy ones,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but the wicked will be put to silence in darkness;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for no man will prevail by strength.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will thunder against them in the sky.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will give strength to his king,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and exalt the horn of his anointed.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn’t know Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the meat was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought up for himself. They did this to all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Yes, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires;” then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised Yahweh’s offering.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “May Yahweh give you offspring<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> from this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.” Then they went to their own home.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear! You make Yahweh’s people disobey.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> If one man sins against another, God will judge him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will intercede for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh and also with men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Didn’t I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Didn’t I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> “Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house and the house of your father should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me will be cursed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> the days come that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house, that there will not be an old man in your house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> You will see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I will give Israel. There shall not be an old man in your house forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> The man of yours whom I don’t cut off from my altar will consume your eyes<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> and grieve your heart. All the increase of your house will die in the flower of their age.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> This will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will both die.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> I will raise up a faithful priest for myself who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house. He will walk before my anointed forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> It will happen that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.”’”</div>
