<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were elder than he.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“I am young, and you are very old.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I said, ‘Days should speak,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But there is a spirit in man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the Spirit<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of the Almighty gives them understanding.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> It is not the great who are wise,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor the aged who understand justice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I also will show my opinion.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “Behold, I waited for your words,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I listened for your reasoning,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>while you searched out what to say.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yes, I gave you my full attention,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but there was no one who convinced Job,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or who answered his words, among you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>God may refute him, not man;’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> for he has not directed his words against me;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither will I answer him with your speeches.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> “They are amazed. They answer no more.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They don’t have a word to say.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Shall I wait, because they don’t speak,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because they stand still, and answer no more?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> I also will answer my part,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I also will show my opinion.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For I am full of words.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The spirit within me constrains me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>like new wineskins it is ready to burst.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> I will speak, that I may be refreshed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will open my lips and answer.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Please don’t let me respect any man’s person,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither will I give flattering titles to any man.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> For I don’t know how to give flattering titles,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or else my Maker would soon take me away.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
