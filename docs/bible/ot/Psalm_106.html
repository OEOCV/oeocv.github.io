<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> We have sinned with our fathers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We have committed iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We have done wickedly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that he might make his mighty power known.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> The waters covered their adversaries.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There was not one of them left.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Then they believed his words.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They sang his praise.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> They soon forgot his works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They didn’t wait for his counsel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> but gave in to craving in the desert,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and tested God in the wasteland.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> He gave them their request,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but sent leanness into their soul.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and covered the company of Abiram.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> A fire was kindled in their company.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The flame burned up the wicked.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> They made a calf in Horeb,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and worshiped a molten image.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Thus they exchanged their glory<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for an image of a bull that eats grass.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> They forgot God, their Savior,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who had done great things in Egypt,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> wondrous works in the land of Ham,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and awesome things by the Red Sea.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Therefore he said that he would destroy them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Yes, they despised the pleasant land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They didn’t believe his word,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> but murmured in their tents,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Therefore he swore to them<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and scatter them in the lands.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The plague broke in on them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so the plague was stopped.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> That was credited to him for righteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for all generations to come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> because they were rebellious against his spirit,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he spoke rashly with his lips.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> They didn’t destroy the peoples,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as Yahweh commanded them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> but mixed themselves with the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and learned their works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> They served their idols,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>which became a snare to them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> They shed innocent blood,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The land was polluted with blood.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> Thus they were defiled with their works,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and prostituted themselves in their deeds.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He abhorred his inheritance.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> He gave them into the hand of the nations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Those who hated them ruled over them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They were brought into subjection under their hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> He rescued them many times,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but they were rebellious in their counsel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and were brought low in their iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> Nevertheless he regarded their distress,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when he heard their cry.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> He remembered for them his covenant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> He made them also to be pitied<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>by all those who carried them captive.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> Save us, Yahweh, our God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>gather us from among the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to give thanks to your holy name,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to triumph in your praise!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
