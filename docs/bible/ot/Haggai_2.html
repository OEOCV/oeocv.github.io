<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> ‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as nothing?</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says Yahweh. ‘Be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ says Yahweh, ‘and work, for I am with you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. ‘Don’t be afraid.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For this is what Yahweh of Armies says: ‘Yet once more, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> and I will shake all nations. The treasure of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of Armies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says Yahweh of Armies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> ‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Yahweh of Armies; ‘and in this place I will give peace,’ says Yahweh of Armies.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “Yahweh of Armies says: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> ‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The priests answered, “No.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The priests answered, “It will be unclean.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Then Haggai answered, “‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me,’ says Yahweh; ‘and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in Yahweh’s temple.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> ‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was laid, consider it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t produced. From today I will bless you.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Yahweh’s word came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will shake the heavens and the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, I will take you, Zerubbabel my servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says Yahweh, ‘and will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.”</div>
