<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> His sons didn’t walk in his ways, but turned away after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> They said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Samuel prayed to Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me as the king over them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so they also do to you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Now therefore, listen to their voice. However, you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who will reign over them.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Samuel told all Yahweh’s words to the people who asked him for a king.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them as his servants, for his chariots and to be his horsemen; and they will run before his chariots.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest; and to make his instruments of war and the instruments of his chariots.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> He will take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks, and to be bakers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even your best, and give them to his servants.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> He will take one tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give it to his officers and to his servants.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> He will take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys, and assign them to his own work.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> He will take one tenth of your flocks; and you will be his servants.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> You will cry out in that day because of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king over us,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and make them a king.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go to your own city.”</div>
