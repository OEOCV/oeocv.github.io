<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> However, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Yahweh struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house. Jotham, the king’s son, was over the household, judging the people of the land.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in David’s city; and Jotham his son reigned in his place.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as his fathers had done. He didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him before the people and killed him, and reigned in his place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> This was Yahweh’s word which he spoke to Jehu, saying, “Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.” So it came to pass.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned for a month in Samaria.</div>

<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Then Menahem attacked Tiphsah and all who were in it and its border areas, from Tirzah. He attacked it because they didn’t open their gates to him, and he ripped up all their women who were with child.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> In the thirty ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. He didn’t depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.</div>

<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes. He did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of Yahweh’s house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</div>
