<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Set your house in order, for you will die, and not live.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and said, “Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Isaiah, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> “Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.”’” So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I am deprived of the residue of my years.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I said, “I won’t see Yah,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yah in the land of the living.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> My dwelling is removed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and is carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have rolled up my life like a weaver.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will cut me off from the loom.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>From day even to night you will make an end of me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I waited patiently until morning.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He breaks all my bones like a lion.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>From day even to night you will make an end of me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I chattered like a swallow or a crane.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I moaned like a dove.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My eyes weaken looking upward.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Lord, I am oppressed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Be my security.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> What will I say?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Lord, men live by these things;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and my spirit finds life in all of them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You restore me, and cause me to live.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Behold, for peace I had great anguish,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for you have cast all my sins behind your back.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For Sheol<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> can’t praise you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Death can’t celebrate you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Those who go down into the pit can’t hope for your truth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do today.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The father shall make known your truth to the children.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Yahweh will save me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in Yahweh’s house.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to Yahweh’s house?”</div>
