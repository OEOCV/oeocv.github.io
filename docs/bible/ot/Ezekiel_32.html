<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> ‘Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“You were likened to a young lion of the nations;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet you are as a monster in the seas.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You broke out with your rivers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and troubled the waters with your feet,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and fouled their rivers.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> The Lord Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will bring you up in my net.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I will leave you on the land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will cast you out on the open field,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I will lay your flesh on the mountains,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and fill the valleys with your height.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I will also water the land in which you swim with your blood,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even to the mountains.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The watercourses will be full of you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and make its stars dark.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will cover the sun with a cloud,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the moon won’t give its light.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and set darkness on your land,” says the Lord Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> “I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when I bring your destruction among the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>into the countries which you have not known.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their kings will be horribly afraid for you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when I brandish my sword before them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will tremble at every moment,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>every man for his own life,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the day of your fall.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For the Lord Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of the mighty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are all the ruthless of the nations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will bring the pride of Egypt to nothing,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all its multitude will be destroyed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The foot of man won’t trouble them any more,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor will the hoofs of animals trouble them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Then I will make their waters clear,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cause their rivers to run like oil,”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>says the Lord Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> “When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a land destitute of that of which it was full,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when I strike all those who dwell therein,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>then they will know that I am Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> “‘“This is the lamentation with which they will lament. The daughters of the nations will lament with this. They will lament with it over Egypt, and over all her multitude,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> “Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.</div>

<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> “Asshur is there with all her company. Her graves are all around her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> “There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> They have made Elam a bed among the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are around her, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. He is put among those who are slain.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> “There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude. Their graves are around them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> They will not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war and have laid their swords under their heads. Their iniquities are on their bones; for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> “But you will be broken among the uncircumcised, and will lie with those who are slain by the sword.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> “There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword. They will lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> “There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain.
