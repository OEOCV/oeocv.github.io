<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I also will set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given of his offspring to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> If the people of the land all hide their eyes from that person when he gives of his offspring to Molech, and don’t put him to death,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> then I will set my face against that man and against his family, and will cut him off, and all who play the prostitute after him to play the prostitute with Molech, from among their people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “‘The person that turns to those who are mediums and wizards, to play the prostitute after them, I will even set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
