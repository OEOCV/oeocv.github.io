<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> But for your holy ones there was great light.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their enemies, hearing their voice but not seeing their form,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>counted it a happy thing that they too had suffered,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> yet for that they do not hurt them, though wronged by them before, they are thankful;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and because they had been at variance with them, they begged for pardon.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore you provided a burning pillar of fire,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to be a guide for your people’s unknown journey,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a harmless sun for their glorious exile.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For the Egyptians well deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned by darkness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they who had imprisoned your children,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>through whom the incorruptible light of the law was to be given to the race of men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> After they had taken counsel to kill the babes of the holy ones,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and when a single child had been abandoned and saved to convict them of their sin,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you took away from them their multitude of children,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and destroyed all their army together in a mighty flood.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Our fathers were made aware of that night beforehand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that, having sure knowledge, they might be cheered by the oaths which they had trusted.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Salvation of the righteous and destruction of the enemies was expected by your people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For as you took vengeance on the adversaries,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>by the same means, calling us to yourself, you glorified us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For holy children of good men offered sacrifice in secret,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and with one consent they agreed to the covenant of the divine law,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that they would partake alike in the same good things and the same perils,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the fathers already leading the sacred songs of praise.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> But the discordant cry of the enemies echoed back,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a pitiful voice of lamentation for children was spread abroad.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Both servant and master were punished with the same just doom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the commoner suffering the same as king;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yes, they all together, under one form of death,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>had corpses without number.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For the living were not sufficient even to bury them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Since at a single stroke, their most cherished offspring was consumed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For while they were disbelieving all things by reason of the enchantments,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>upon the destruction of the firstborn they confessed the people to be God’s children.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For while peaceful silence wrapped all things,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and night in her own swiftness was half spent,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> your all-powerful word leaped from heaven, from the royal throne,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a stern warrior, into the midst of the doomed land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> bearing as a sharp sword your authentic commandment,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and standing, it filled all things with death,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and while it touched the heaven it stood upon the earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Then immediately apparitions in dreams terribly troubled them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and unexpected fears came upon them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> And each, one thrown here half dead, another there,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>made known why he was dying;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> for the dreams, disturbing them, forewarned them of this,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that they might not perish without knowing why they were afflicted.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> The experience of death also touched the righteous,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a multitude were destroyed in the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but the wrath didn’t last long.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For a blameless man hurried to be their champion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>bringing the weapon of his own ministry,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>prayer, and the atoning sacrifice of incense.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He withstood the indignation and set an end to the calamity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>showing that he was your servant.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> And he overcame the anger,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>not by strength of body, not by force of weapons,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but by his word, he subdued the avenger<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>by bringing to remembrance oaths and covenants made with the fathers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For when the dead had already fallen in heaps one upon another,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he intervened and stopped the wrath,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cut off its way to the living.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> For the whole world was pictured on his long robe,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the glories of the fathers were upon the engraving of the four rows of precious stones,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your majesty was upon the diadem on his head.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> The destroyer yielded to these, and they feared;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for it was enough only to test the wrath.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
