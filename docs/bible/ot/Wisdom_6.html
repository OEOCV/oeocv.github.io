<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Hear therefore, you kings, and understand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Learn, you judges of the ends of the earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Give ear, you rulers who have dominion over many people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and make your boast<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> in multitudes of nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> because your dominion was given to you from the Lord,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your sovereignty from the Most High.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will search out your works,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will inquire about your plans,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> because being officers of his kingdom, you didn’t judge rightly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor did you keep the law,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor did you walk according to God’s counsel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> He will come upon you awfully and swiftly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because a stern judgment comes on those who are in high places.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For the man of low estate may be pardoned in mercy,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but mighty men will be mightily tested.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For the Sovereign Lord of all will not be impressed with anyone,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither will he show deference to greatness;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because it is he who made both small and great,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cares about them all;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> but the scrutiny that comes upon the powerful is strict.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore, my words are to you, O princes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that you may learn wisdom and not fall away.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For those who have kept the things that are holy in holiness will be made holy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Those who have been taught them will find what to say in defense.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Therefore set your desire on my words.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Long for them, and you princes will be instructed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Wisdom is radiant and doesn’t fade away;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and is easily seen by those who love her,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and found by those who seek her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> She anticipates those who desire her, making herself known.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> He who rises up early to seek her won’t have difficulty,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he will find her sitting at his gates.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For to think upon her is perfection of understanding,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he who watches for her will quickly be free from care;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> because she herself goes around, seeking those who are worthy of her,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in their paths she appears to them graciously,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in every purpose she meets them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For her true beginning is desire for instruction;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and desire for instruction is love.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> And love is observance of her laws.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>To give heed to her laws confirms immortality.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Immortality brings closeness to God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> So then desire for wisdom promotes to a kingdom.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> If therefore you delight in thrones and sceptres, you princes of peoples,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>honor wisdom, that you may reign forever.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But what wisdom is, and how she came into being, I will declare.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I won’t hide mysteries from you;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but I will explore from her first beginning,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>bring the knowledge of her into clear light,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will not pass by the truth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Indeed, I won’t travel with consuming envy,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because envy will have no fellowship with wisdom.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But a multitude of wise men is salvation to the world,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and an understanding king is stability for his people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore be instructed by my words, and you will profit.</div>
