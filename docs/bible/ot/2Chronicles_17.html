<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek the Baals,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> but sought the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> and with them Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> They taught in Judah, having the book of Yahweh’s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’|strong="H1" houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready and prepared for war.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> These were those who waited on the king, in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</div>
