<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> One called to another, and said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The whole earth is full of his glory!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He said, “Go, and tell this people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘You hear indeed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but don’t understand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You see indeed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but don’t perceive.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Make the heart of this people fat.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>lest they see with their eyes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>hear with their ears,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>understand with their heart,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and turn again, and be healed.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Then I said, “Lord, how long?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He answered,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Until cities are waste without inhabitant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>houses without man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the land becomes utterly waste,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> and Yahweh has removed men far away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the forsaken places are many within the land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> If there is a tenth left in it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that also will in turn be consumed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as a terebinth, and as an oak whose stump remains when they are cut down,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so the holy seed is its stump.”</div>
