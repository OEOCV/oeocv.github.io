<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> “I have trodden the wine press alone.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Of the peoples, no one was with me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, I trod them in my anger<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and trampled them in my wrath.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I have stained all my clothing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For the day of vengeance was in my heart,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the year of my redeemed has come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I looked, and there was no one to help;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I wondered that there was no one to uphold.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My own wrath upheld me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I trod down the peoples in my anger<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and made them drunk in my wrath.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I poured their lifeblood out on the earth.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
