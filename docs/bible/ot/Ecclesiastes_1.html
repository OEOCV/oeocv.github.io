<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>Ecclesiastes or, The Preacher</h2><span class="vn">1</span> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> That which has been is that which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> this is new?” It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</div>
