<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> “In that day there will be a fountain opened to David’s house and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they will be remembered no more. I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> It will happen that when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, ‘You must die, because you speak lies in Yahweh’s name;’ and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> It will happen in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they won’t wear a hairy mantle to deceive,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> but he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> One will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your arms?’ Then he will answer, ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> “Awake, sword, against my shepherd,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and against the man who is close to me,” says Yahweh of Armies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will turn my hand against the little ones.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> It shall happen that in all the land,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“two parts in it will be cut off and die;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but the third will be left in it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> I will bring the third part into the fire,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will refine them as silver is refined,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will test them like gold is tested.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will call on my name, and I will hear them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will say, ‘It is my people;’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will say, ‘Yahweh is my God.’”</div>
