<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy every living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the sky’s windows opened.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship—</div>
