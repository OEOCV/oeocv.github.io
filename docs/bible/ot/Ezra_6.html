<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Moreover I make a decree regarding what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses must be given with all diligence to these men, that they not be hindered.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> That which they have need of, including young bulls, rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail,</div>

<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I have also made a decree that whoever alters this message, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened on it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> May the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who stretch out their hand to alter this, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem.

<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions did accordingly with all diligence, because Darius the king had sent a decree.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> The elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.

<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Because the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together, all of them were pure. They killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> The children of Israel who had returned out of the captivity, and all who had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, ate,</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; because Yahweh had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of God, the God of Israel’s house.</div>
