<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Oh that my head were waters,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and my eyes a spring of tears,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that I might weep day and night<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the slain of the daughter of my people!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Oh that I had in the wilderness<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a lodging place of wayfaring men,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that I might leave my people<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and go from them!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For they are all adulterers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>an assembly of treacherous men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> “They bend their tongue,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as their bow, for falsehood.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They have grown strong in the land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but not for truth;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they proceed from evil to evil,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they don’t know me,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> “Everyone beware of his neighbor,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and don’t trust in any brother;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for every brother will utterly supplant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and every neighbor will go around like a slanderer.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Friends deceive each other,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will not speak the truth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They have taught their tongue to speak lies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They weary themselves committing iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Your habitation is in the middle of deceit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Through deceit, they refuse to know me,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore Yahweh of Armies says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold, I will melt them and test them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for how should I deal with the daughter of my people?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Their tongue is a deadly arrow.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It speaks deceit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>One speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but in his heart, he waits to ambush him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Shouldn’t I punish them for these things?” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Shouldn’t my soul be avenged on a nation such as this?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I will weep and wail for the mountains,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and lament for the pastures of the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because they are burned up, so that no one passes through;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Men can’t hear the voice of the livestock.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Both the birds of the sky and the animals have fled.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are gone.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “I will make Jerusalem heaps,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a dwelling place of jackals.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>without inhabitant.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken, that he may declare it? Why has the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Yahweh says, “Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in my ways,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, “Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Yahweh of Armies says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Consider, and call for the mourning women, that they may come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Send for the skillful women, that they may come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Let them make haste<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and take up a wailing for us,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that our eyes may run down with tears<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and our eyelids gush out with waters.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘How we are ruined!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We are greatly confounded<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because we have forsaken the land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because they have cast down our dwellings.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Yet hear Yahweh’s word, you women.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let your ear receive the word of his mouth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Teach your daughters wailing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Everyone teach her neighbor a lamentation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For death has come up into our windows.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It has entered into our palaces<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to cut off the children from outside,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the young men from the streets.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Speak, “Yahweh says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“‘The dead bodies of men will fall as dung on the open field,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and as the handful after the harvester.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>No one will gather them.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Yahweh says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Don’t let the wise man glory in his wisdom.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t let the mighty man glory in his might.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t let the rich man glory in his riches.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But let him who glories glory in this,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that he has understanding, and knows me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that I am Yahweh who exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness in the earth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I delight in these things,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will punish all those who are circumcised only in their flesh:</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Egypt, Judah, Edom, the children of Ammon, Moab, and all who have the corners of their hair cut off, who dwell in the wilderness, for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.”</div>
