<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> When Eleazar had in this manner answered the exhortations of the tyrant, the spearbearers came up, and rudely dragged Eleazar to the instruments of torture.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> First, they stripped the old man, adorned as he was with the beauty of piety.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Then tying back his arms and hands, they disdainfully flogged him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> A herald opposite cried out, “Obey the commands of the king!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But the high-minded and truly noble Eleazar, as one tortured in a dream, ignored it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But raising his eyes on high to heaven, the old man’s flesh was stripped off by the scourges, and his blood streamed down, and his sides were pierced through.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Falling on the ground from his body having no power to endure the pains, he still kept his reasoning upright and unbending.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Then one of the harsh spearbearers rushed at him and began to kick him in the side to force him to get up again after he fell.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> But he endured the pains, despised the cruelty, and persevered through the indignities.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Like a noble athlete, the old man, when struck, vanquished his torturers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> His face sweating, and he panting for breath, he was admired even by the torturers for his courage.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Therefore, partly in pity for his old age,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> partly from the sympathy of acquaintance, and partly in admiration of his endurance, some of the attendants of the king said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> “Why do you unreasonably destroy yourself, O Eleazar, with these miseries?</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> We will bring you some meat cooked by yourself, and you can save yourself by pretending that you have eaten swine’s flesh.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Eleazar, as though the advice more painfully tortured him, cried out,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> “Let us who are children of Abraham not be so evil advised as by giving way to make use of an unbecoming pretense.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For it would be irrational, if having lived up to old age in all truth, and having scrupulously guarded our character for it, we would now turn back</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> and ourselves become a pattern of impiety to the young, as being an example of eating pollution.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> It would be disgraceful if we would live on some short time, and that scorned by all men for cowardice,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> and be condemned by the tyrant for cowardice by not contending to the death for our divine law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Therefore you, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> You spearbearers of the tyrant, why do you linger?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Beholding him so high-minded against misery, and not changing at their pity, they led him to the fire.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Then with their wickedly contrived instruments they burned him on the fire, and poured stinking fluids down into his nostrils.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> He being at length burned down to the bones, and about to expire, raised his eyes Godward, and said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> “You know, O God, that when I might have been saved, I am slain for the sake of the law by tortures of fire.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Be merciful to your people, and be satisfied with the punishment of me on their account.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Let my blood be a purification for them, and take my life in exchange for theirs.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Thus speaking, the holy man departed, noble in his torments, and even to the agonies of death resisted in his reasoning for the sake of the law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Confessedly, therefore, religious reasoning is master of the emotions.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> For had the emotions been superior to reasoning, I would have given them the witness of this mastery.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> But now, since reasoning conquered the emotions, we befittingly award it the authority of first place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> It is only fair that we should allow that the power belongs to reasoning, since it masters external miseries.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> It would be ridiculous if it weren’t so. I prove that reasoning has not only mastered pains, but that it is also superior to the pleasures, and withstands them.</div>
