<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> But Mordecai, having perceived what was done, tore his garments, put on sackcloth, and sprinkled dust upon himself. Having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, “A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He came to the king’s gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace wearing sackcloth and ashes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> And in every province where the letters were published, there was crying, lamentation, and great mourning on the part of the Jews. They wore sackcloth and ashes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The queen’s maids and chamberlains went in and told her; and when she had heard what was done, she was deeply troubled. She sent clothes to Mordecai to replace his sackcloth, but he refused.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> So Esther called for her chamberlain Hathach, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mordecai.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Mordecai showed him what was done, and the promise which Haman had made the king of ten thousand talents to be paid into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> And he gave him the copy of what was published in Susa concerning their destruction to show to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and entreat the king, and to beg him for the people. “Remember, he said, the days of your humble condition, how you were nursed by my hand; because Haman, who holds the next place to the king, has spoken against us to cause our death. Call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> So Hathach went in and told her all these words.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Esther said to Hathach, “Go to Mordecai, and say,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> ‘All the nations of the empire know than any man or woman who goes in to the king into the inner court without being called, that person must die, unless the king stretches out his golden sceptre; then he shall live. I haven’t been called to go into the king for thirty days.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> So Hathach reported to Mordecai all the words of Esther.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then Mordecai said to Hathach, “Go, and say to her, ‘Esther, don’t say to yourself that you alone will escape in the kingdom, more than all the other Jews.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For if you keep quiet on this occasion, help and protection will come to the Jews from another place; but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you have been made queen for this occasion?’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> And Esther sent the messenger who came to her to Mordecai, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> “Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and all of you fast for me. Don’t eat or drink for three days, night and day. My maidens and I will also fast. Then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> So Mordecai went and did all that Esther commanded him.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> [He prayed to the Lord, making mention of all the works of the Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> He said, “Lord<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> God, you are king ruling over all, for all things are in your power, and there is no one who can oppose you in your purpose to save Israel;</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> for you have made the heaven and the earth and every wonderful thing under heaven.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> You are Lord of all, and there is no one who can resist you, Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> You know all things. You know, Lord, that it is not in insolence, nor arrogance, nor love of glory, that I have done this, to refuse to bow down to the arrogant Haman.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet for the safety of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> But I have done this that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God. I will not worship anyone except you, my Lord, and I will not do these things in arrogance.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> And now, O Lord God, the King, the God of Abraham, spare your people, for our enemies are planning our destruction, and they have desired to destroy your ancient inheritance.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Do not overlook your people, whom you have redeemed for yourself out of the land of Egypt.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Listen to my prayer. Have mercy on your inheritance and turn our mourning into gladness, that we may live and sing praise to your name, O Lord. Don’t utterly destroy the mouth of those who praise you, O Lord.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> All Israel cried with all their might, for death was before their eyes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> And queen Esther took refuge in the Lord, being taken as it were in the agony of death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Having taken off her glorious apparel, she put on garments of distress and mourning. Instead of grand perfumes she filled her head with ashes and dung. She greatly humbled her body, and she filled every place of her glad adorning with her tangled hair.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> She implored the Lord God of Israel, and said, “O my Lord, you alone are our king. Help me. I am destitute, and have no helper but you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> for my danger is near at hand<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> I have heard from my birth in the tribe of my kindred that you, Lord, took Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their kindred for a perpetual inheritance, and have done for them all that you have said.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> And now we have sinned before you, and you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies,</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> because we honored their gods. You are righteous, O Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> But now they have not been content with the bitterness of our slavery, but have laid their hands on the hands of their idols</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> to abolish the decree of your mouth, and utterly to destroy your inheritance, and to stop the mouth of those who praise you, and to extinguish the glory of your house and your altar,</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> and to open the mouth of the Gentiles to speak the<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> praises of vanities, and that a mortal king should be admired forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> O Lord, don’t surrender your sceptre to those who don’t exist, and don’t let them laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel against themselves, and make an example of him who has begun to injure us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> Remember us, O Lord! Manifest yourself in the time of our affliction. Encourage me, O King of gods, and ruler of all dominion!</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> Put harmonious speech into my mouth before the lion, and turn his heart to hate him who fights against us, to the utter destruction of those who agree with him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> But deliver us by your hand, and help me who am alone and have no one but you, O Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> You know all things, and know that I hate the glory of transgressors,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> and that I abhor the bed of the uncircumcised and of every stranger.</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> You know my necessity, for I abhor the symbol of my proud station, which is upon my head in the days of my<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> splendor. I abhor it as a menstruous cloth, and I don’t wear it in the days of my tranquility.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> Your handmaid has not eaten at Haman’s table, and I have not honored the banquet of the king, neither have I drunk wine of libations.</div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> Neither has your handmaid rejoiced since the day of my promotion until now, except in you, O Lord God of Abraham.</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> O god, who has power over all, listen to the voice of the desperate, and deliver us from the hand of those who devise mischief. Deliver me from my fear.]</div>
