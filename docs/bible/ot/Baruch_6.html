<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><h6 class="depth-5">The Letter of Jeremy (Jeremiah)</h6><span class="vn">1</span> A copy of a letter that Jeremy sent to those who were to be led captives into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians, to give them the message that God commanded him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Because of the sins which you have committed before God, you will be led away captives to Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of the Babylonians.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> So when you come to Babylon, you will remain there many years, and for a long season, even for seven generations. After that, I will bring you out peacefully from there.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But now you will see in Babylon gods of silver, gold, wood carried on shoulders, which cause the nations to fear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Beware therefore that you in no way become like these foreigners. Don’t let fear take hold of you because of them when you see the multitude before them and behind them, worshiping them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But say in your hearts, “O Lord, we must worship you.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For my angel is with you, and I myself care for your souls.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For their tongue is polished by the workman, and they themselves are overlaid with gold and with silver; yet they are only fake, and can’t speak.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> And taking gold, as if it were for a virgin who loves to be happy, they make crowns for the heads of their gods.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Sometimes also the priests take gold and silver from their gods, and spend it on themselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> The will even give some of it to the common prostitutes. They dress them like men with garments, even the gods of silver, gods of gold, and gods of wood.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yet these gods can’t save themselves from rust and moths, even though they are covered with purple garments.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, which is thick upon them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> And he who can’t put to death one who offends against him holds a sceptre, as though he were judge of a country.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> He has also a dagger in his right hand, and an axe, but can’t deliver himself from war and robbers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> By this they are known not to be gods. Therefore don’t fear them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For like a vessel that a man uses is worth nothing when it is broken, even so it is with their gods. When they are set up in the temples, their eyes are full of dust through the feet of those who come in.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> As the courts are secured on every side upon him who offends the king, as being committed to suffer death, even so the priests secure their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lest they be carried off by robbers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> They light candles for them, yes, more than for themselves, even though they can’t see one.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> They are like one of the beams of the temple. Men say their hearts are eaten out when things creeping out of the earth devour both them and their clothing. They don’t feel it</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> when their faces are blackened through the smoke that comes out of the temple.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Bats, swallows, and birds land on their bodies and heads. So do the cats.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> By this you may know that they are no gods. Therefore don’t fear them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Notwithstanding the gold with which they are covered to make them beautiful, unless someone wipes off the tarnish, they won’t shine; for they didn’t even feel it when they were molten.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Things in which there is no breath are bought at any cost.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Having no feet, they are carried upon shoulders. By this, they declare to men that they are worth nothing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Those who serve them are also ashamed, for if they fall to the ground at any time, they can’t rise up again by themselves. If they are bowed down, they can’t make themselves straight; but the offerings are set before them, as if they were dead men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> And the things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and spend. In like manner, their wives also lay up part of it in salt; but to the poor and to the impotent they give none of it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> The menstruous woman and the woman in childbed touch their sacrifices, knowing therefore by these things that they are no gods. Don’t fear them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> For how can they be called gods? Because women set food before the gods of silver, gold, and wood.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> And in their temples the priests sit on seats, having their clothes torn and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing on their heads.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> The priests also take off garments from them and clothe their wives and children with them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Whether it is evil or good what one does to them, they are not able to repay it. They can’t set up a king or put him down.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money. Though a man make a vow to them and doesn’t keep it, they will never exact it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> They can save no man from death. They can’t deliver the weak from the mighty.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> They can’t restore a blind man to his sight, or deliver anyone who is in distress.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> They can show no mercy to the widow, or do good to the fatherless.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> They are like the stones that are cut out of the mountain, these gods of wood that are overlaid with gold and with silver. Those who minister to them will be confounded.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> How could a man then think or say that they are gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them?</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> If they shall see one mute who can’t speak, they bring him and ask him to call upon Bel, as though he were able to understand.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> Yet they can’t perceive this themselves, and forsake them; for they have no understanding.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> The women also with cords around them sit in the ways, burning bran for incense; but if any of them, drawn by someone who passes by, lies with him, she reproaches her fellow, that she was not thought as worthy as herself and her cord wasn’t broken.</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> Whatever is done among them is false. How could a man then think or say that they are gods?</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> They are fashioned by carpenters and goldsmiths. They can be nothing else than what the workmen make them to be.</div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> And they themselves who fashioned them can never continue long. How then should the things that are fashioned by them?</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> For they have left lies and reproaches to those who come after.</div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> For when there comes any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves, where they may be hidden with them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> How then can’t men understand that they are no gods, which can’t save themselves from war or from plague?</div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> For seeing they are only wood and overlaid with gold and silver, it will be known hereafter that they are false.</div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> It will be manifest to all nations and kings that they are no gods, but the works of men’s hands, and that there is no work of God in them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> Who then may not know that they are not gods?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> For they can’t set up a king in a land or give rain to men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v54"><span class="vn">54</span> They can’t judge their own cause, or redress a wrong, being unable; for they are like crows between heaven and earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v55"><span class="vn">55</span> For even when fire falls upon the house of gods of wood overlaid with gold or with silver, their priests will flee away, and escape, but they themselves will be burned apart like beams.</div>
<div class="v" id="v56"><span class="vn">56</span> Moreover they can’t withstand any king or enemies. How could a man then admit or think that they are gods?</div>
<div class="v" id="v57"><span class="vn">57</span> Those gods of wood overlaid with silver or with gold aren’t able to escape from thieves or robbers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v58"><span class="vn">58</span> The gold, silver, and garments with which they are clothed—those who are strong will take from them, and go away with them. They won’t be able to help themselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v59"><span class="vn">59</span> Therefore it is better to be a king who shows his manhood, or else a vessel in a house profitable for whatever the owner needs, than such false gods—or even a door in a house, to keep the things safe that are in it, than such false gods; or better to be a pillar of wood in a palace than such false gods.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v60"><span class="vn">60</span> For sun, moon, and stars, being bright and sent to do their jobs, are obedient.</div>
<div class="v" id="v61"><span class="vn">61</span> Likewise also the lightning when it flashes is beautiful to see. In the same way, the wind also blows in every country.</div>
<div class="v" id="v62"><span class="vn">62</span> And when God commands the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are told.</div>
<div class="v" id="v63"><span class="vn">63</span> And the fire sent from above to consume mountains and woods does as it is commanded; but these are to be compared to them neither in show nor power.</div>
<div class="v" id="v64"><span class="vn">64</span> Therefore a man shouldn’t think or say that they are gods, seeing they aren’t able to judge causes or to do good to men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v65"><span class="vn">65</span> Knowing therefore that they are no gods, don’t fear them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v66"><span class="vn">66</span> For they can neither curse nor bless kings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v67"><span class="vn">67</span> They can’t show signs in the heavens among the nations, or shine as the sun, or give light as the moon.</div>
<div class="v" id="v68"><span class="vn">68</span> The beasts are better than they; for they can get under a covert, and help themselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v69"><span class="vn">69</span> In no way then is it manifest to us that they are gods. Therefore don’t fear them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v70"><span class="vn">70</span> For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers that keeps nothing, so are their gods of wood overlaid with gold and silver.</div>
<div class="v" id="v71"><span class="vn">71</span> Likewise also their gods of wood overlaid with gold and with silver, are like a white thorn in an orchard that every bird sits upon. They are also like a dead body that is thrown out into the dark.</div>
<div class="v" id="v72"><span class="vn">72</span> You will know them to be no gods by the bright purple that rots upon them. They themselves will be consumed afterwards, and will be a reproach in the country.</div>
<div class="v" id="v73"><span class="vn">73</span> Better therefore is the just man who has no idols; for he will be far from reproach.</div>
