<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For, behold, the days come,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will reverse the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“We have heard a voice of trembling;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a voice of fear, and not of peace.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all faces are turned pale?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It is even the time of Jacob’s trouble;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but he will be saved out of it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will burst your bonds.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> but they will serve Yahweh their God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and David their king,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>whom I will raise up to them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t be dismayed, Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For, behold, I will save you from afar,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and save your offspring from the land of their captivity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Jacob will return,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will be quiet and at ease.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>No one will make him afraid.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but I will not make a full end of you;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but I will correct you in measure,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will in no way leave you unpunished.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For Yahweh says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Your hurt is incurable.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Your wound is grievous.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> There is no one to plead your cause,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that you may be bound up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You have no healing medicines.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> All your lovers have forgotten you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They don’t seek you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>with the chastisement of a cruel one,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the greatness of your iniquity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because your sins were increased.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Why do you cry over your injury?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Your pain is incurable.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For the greatness of your iniquity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because your sins have increased,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have done these things to you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>All your adversaries, everyone of them, will go into captivity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Those who plunder you will be plunder.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will make all who prey on you become prey.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For I will restore health to you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will heal you of your wounds,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“because they have called you an outcast,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>saying, ‘It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob’s tents,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and have compassion on his dwelling places.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The city will be built on its own hill,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the palace will be inhabited in its own place.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Thanksgiving will proceed out of them<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>with the voice of those who make merry.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will multiply them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will not be few;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will also glorify them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will not be small.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Their children also will be as before,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their congregation will be established before me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will punish all who oppress them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Their prince will be one of them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their ruler will proceed from among them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will cause him to draw near,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he will approach me;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for who is he who has had boldness to approach me?” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> “You shall be my people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will be your God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a sweeping storm;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>it will burst on the head of the wicked.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return until he has accomplished,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and until he has performed the intentions of his heart.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>In the latter days you will understand it.”</div>
