<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now these are the last words of David.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>David the son of Jesse says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the man who was raised on high says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the anointed of the God of Jacob,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the sweet psalmist of Israel:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Yahweh’s Spirit spoke by me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>His word was on my tongue.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> The God of Israel said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the Rock of Israel spoke to me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘One who rules over men righteously,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who rules in the fear of God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> shall be as the light of the morning when the sun rises,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a morning without clouds,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when the tender grass springs out of the earth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>through clear shining after rain.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Isn’t my house so with God?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>ordered in all things, and sure,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for it is all my salvation and all my desire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Won’t he make it grow?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But all the ungodly will be as thorns to be thrust away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because they can’t be taken with the hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will be utterly burned with fire in their place.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; he was called Adino the Eznite, who killed eight hundred at one time.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take plunder.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But he stood in the middle of the plot and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> David said longingly, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David; but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> He said, “Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this! Isn’t this the blood of the men who risked their lives to go?” Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Wasn’t he most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain. However he wasn’t included as one of the three.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in a time of snow.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> He killed a huge Egyptian, and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three. David set him over his guard.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
