<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh—a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a free will offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, of the herd, or of the flock—</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of one tenth of an ephah<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of fine flour mixed with one fourth of a hin<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> of oil.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> You shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “‘For a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenths of an ephah<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil;</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> then he shall offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenths of an ephah<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil;</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Thus it shall be done for each bull, for each ram, for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, as you do, so he shall do.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations. As you are, so the foreigner shall be before Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering. As the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Of the first of your dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> “‘When you err, and don’t observe all these commandments which Yahweh has spoken to Moses—</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment and onward throughout your generations—</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, with its meal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to all the people, it was done unwittingly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> “‘If a person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs when he sins unwittingly before Yahweh. He shall make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> “‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, blasphemes Yahweh. That soul shall be cut off from among his people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Because he has despised Yahweh’s word, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall be utterly cut off. His iniquity shall be on him.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as Yahweh commanded Moses.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves fringes<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> of each border a cord of blue.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> It shall be to you for a fringe,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> that you may see it, and remember all Yahweh’s commandments, and do them; and that you don’t follow your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to play the prostitute;</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> so that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Yahweh your God.”</div>
