<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The burden of the wilderness of the sea.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I am so dismayed that I can’t see.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For the Lord said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> The burden of Dumah.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>One calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> The watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> The burden on Arabia.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You will lodge in the thickets in Arabia, you caravans of Dedanites.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> For the Lord said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.”</div>
