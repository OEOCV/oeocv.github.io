<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Even their children remember their altars<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their Asherah poles by the green trees on the high hills.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> My mountain in the field,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will give your substance and all your treasures for a plunder,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> You, even of yourself, will discontinue from your heritage that I gave you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don’t know,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for you have kindled a fire in my anger which will burn forever.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Cursed is the man who trusts in man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>relies on strength of flesh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and whose heart departs from Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For he will be like a bush in the desert,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will not see when good comes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but will inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>an uninhabited salt land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Tell them, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, you kings of Judah, all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Yahweh says, “Be careful, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Don’t carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day. Don’t do any work, but make the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> But they didn’t listen. They didn’t turn their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> It will happen, if you diligently listen to me,” says Yahweh, “to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to make the Sabbath day holy, to do no work therein;</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> then there will enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on David’s throne, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will remain forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> They will come from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country, and from the South, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, meal offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to Yahweh’s house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem. It will not be quenched.”’”</div>
