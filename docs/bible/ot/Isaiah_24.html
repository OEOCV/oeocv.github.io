<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Fear, the pit, and the snare are on you who inhabit the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> It will happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem; and glory will be before his elders.</div>
