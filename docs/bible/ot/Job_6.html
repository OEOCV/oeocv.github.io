<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>therefore my words have been rash.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My spirit drinks up their poison.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or does the ox low over his fodder?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> My soul refuses to touch them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are as loathsome food to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “Oh that I might have my request,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that God would grant the thing that I long for,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> even that it would please God to crush me;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Let it still be my consolation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> What is my strength, that I should wait?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>What is my end, that I should be patient?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Is my strength the strength of stones?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or is my flesh of bronze?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The caravans of Tema looked.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The companies of Sheba waited for them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> They were distressed because they were confident.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They came there, and were confounded.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For now you are nothing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You see a terror, and are afraid.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Did I ever say, ‘Give to me?’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> How forcible are words of uprightness!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>But your reproof, what does it reprove?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Do you intend to reprove words,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and make merchandise of your friend.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Now therefore be pleased to look at me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for surely I will not lie to your face.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Please return.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let there be no injustice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, return again.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My cause is righteous.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Is there injustice on my tongue?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?</div>
