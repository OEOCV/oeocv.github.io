<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (this was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, Yahweh’s word has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear),</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> saying, “Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forever more.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; then I will do you no harm.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> “Yet you have not listened to me,” says Yahweh, “that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore Yahweh of Armies says: “Because you have not heard my words,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,” says Yahweh, “and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around. I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> This whole land will be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> “It will happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,” says Yahweh, “for their iniquity. I will make the land of the Chaldeans desolate forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them, even of them. I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> They will drink, and reel back and forth, and be insane, because of the sword that I will send among them.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Then I took the cup at Yahweh’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me:</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is today;</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes, and all his people;</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon;</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who have the corners of their beard cut off;</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> and all the kings of Arabia, all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness;</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth. The king of Sheshach will drink after them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> “You shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Drink, and be drunk, vomit, fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.”’</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “You shall surely drink.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You will not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh of Armies.”’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> “Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and tell them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“‘Yahweh will roar from on high,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and utter his voice from his holy habitation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will mightily roar against his fold.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will give a shout, as those who tread grapes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>against all the inhabitants of the earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> A noise will come even to the end of the earth;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will enter into judgment with all flesh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>As for the wicked, he will give them to the sword,”’ says Yahweh.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Yahweh of Armies says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold, evil will go out from nation to nation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a great storm will be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> The slain of Yahweh will be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They won’t be lamented. They won’t be gathered or buried. They will be dung on the surface of the ground.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Wail, you shepherds, and cry.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Wallow in dust, you leader of the flock;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you will fall like fine pottery.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> The shepherds will have no way to flee.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The leader of the flock will have no escape.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> A voice of the cry of the shepherds,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the wailing of the leader of the flock,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for Yahweh destroys their pasture.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> The peaceful folds are brought to silence<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> He has left his covert, as the lion;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and because of his fierce anger.</div>
