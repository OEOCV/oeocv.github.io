<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>out of the miry clay.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He set my feet on a rock,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and gave me a firm place to stand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn away to lies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your thoughts which are toward us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They can’t be declared back to you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You have opened my ears.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Then I said, “Behold, I have come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It is written about me in the book in the scroll.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> I delight to do your will, my God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, your law is within my heart.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For innumerable evils have surrounded me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are more than the hairs of my head.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My heart has failed me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Hurry to help me, Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let Yahweh be exalted!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But I am poor and needy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>May the Lord think about me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You are my help and my deliverer.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t delay, my God.</div>
