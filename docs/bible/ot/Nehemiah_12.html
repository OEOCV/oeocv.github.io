<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> The chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers close to them, to praise and give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, section next to section.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving thanks and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and with harps.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> also from Beth Gilgal and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Then I brought the princes of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession. One went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate;</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> and after them went Hoshaiah, with half of the princes of Judah,</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> and his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of David’s city, at the ascent of the wall, above David’s house, even to the water gate eastward.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people on the wall above the tower of the furnaces, even to the wide wall,</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate; and they stood still in the gate of the guard.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> So the two companies of those who gave thanks in God’s house stood, and I and the half of the rulers with me;</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even far away.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> On that day, men were appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them according to the fields of the cities the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who served.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> They performed the duty of their God and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and of Solomon his son.</div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the gatekeepers, as every day required; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.</div>
