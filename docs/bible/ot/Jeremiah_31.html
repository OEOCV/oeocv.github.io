<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh appeared of old to me, saying,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore I have drawn you with loving kindness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I will build you again,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you will be built, O virgin of Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You will again be adorned with your tambourines,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will go out in the dances of those who make merry.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For there will be a day that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim cry,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Arise! Let’s go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For Yahweh says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Sing with gladness for Jacob,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and shout for the chief of the nations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Publish, praise, and say,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Yahweh, save your people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the remnant of Israel!’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Behold, I will bring them from the north country,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>along with the blind and the lame,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the woman with child and her who travails with child together.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will return as a great company.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> They will come with weeping.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will lead them with petitions.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in a straight way in which they won’t stumble;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I am a father to Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Ephraim is my firstborn.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “Hear Yahweh’s word, you nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and declare it in the distant islands.

<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Surely after that I was turned.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I repented.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>After that I was instructed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I struck my thigh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I was ashamed, yes, even confounded,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because I bore the reproach of my youth.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Is Ephraim my dear son?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Is he a darling child?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For as often as I speak against him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I still earnestly remember him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore my heart yearns for him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will surely have mercy on him,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “Set up road signs.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Make guideposts.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Set your heart toward the highway,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even the way by which you went.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Turn again, virgin of Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Turn again to these your cities.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> How long will you go here and there,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you backsliding daughter?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a woman will encompass a man.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Yet again they will use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I reverse their captivity: ‘Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Judah and all its cities will dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of animal.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> It will happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” says Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> “In those days they will say no more,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which covenant of mine they broke, although I was a husband to them,” says Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> “But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” says Yahweh:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“I will put my law in their inward parts,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will write it in their heart.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will be their God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they shall be my people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> They will no longer each teach his neighbor,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and every man teach his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh;’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they will all know me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>from their least to their greatest,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“for I will forgive their iniquity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will remember their sin no more.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar—<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yahweh of Armies is his name, says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> “If these ordinances depart from before me,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“then the offspring of Israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Yahweh says: “If heaven above can be measured,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that the city will be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> The measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and will turn toward Goah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be plucked up or thrown down any more forever.”</div>
