<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for me.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He went to a bare height.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He took up his parable, and said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“From Aram has Balak brought me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the king of Moab from the mountains of the East.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Come, curse Jacob for me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Come, defy Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>How shall I defy whom Yahweh has not defied?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For from the top of the rocks I see him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>From the hills I see him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Behold, it is a people that dwells alone,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and shall not be listed among the nations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Who can count the dust of Jacob,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or count the fourth part of Israel?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let me die the death of the righteous!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let my last end be like his!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them. You shall see just part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse them from there for me.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet God over there.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> He took up his parable, and said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Rise up, Balak, and hear!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Listen to me, you son of Zippor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> God is not a man, that he should lie,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor a son of man, that he should repent.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Has he said, and he won’t do it?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or has he spoken, and he won’t make it good?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Behold, I have received a command to bless.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has blessed, and I can’t reverse it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yahweh his God is with him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The shout of a king is among them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> God brings them out of Egypt.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Neither is there any divination with Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘What has God done!’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Behold, a people rises up as a lioness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>As a lion he lifts himself up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and drinks the blood of the slain.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> But Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</div>
