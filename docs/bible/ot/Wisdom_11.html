<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Wisdom prospered their works in the hand of a holy prophet.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> They traveled through a desert without inhabitant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they pitched their tents in trackless regions.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> They withstood enemies and repelled foes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> They thirsted, and they called upon you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and water was given to them out of the<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> flinty rock,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and healing of their thirst out of the hard stone.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For by what things their foes were punished,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>by these they in their need were benefited.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> When enemies were troubled with clotted blood<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>instead of a river’s ever-flowing fountain,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> to rebuke the decree for the slaying of babies,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you gave them abundant water beyond all hope,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> having shown by the thirst which they had suffered<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>how you punished the adversaries.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For when they were tried, although chastened in mercy,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they learned how the ungodly were tormented, being judged with wrath.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For you tested these as a father admonishing them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but you searched out those as a stern king condemning them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Yes and whether they were far off or near,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they were equally distressed;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> for a double grief seized them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a groaning at the memory of things past.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For when they heard that through their own punishments the others benefited,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they recognized the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For him who long before was thrown out and exposed they stopped mocking.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>In the end of what happened, they marveled,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>having thirsted in another manner than the righteous.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But in return for the senseless imaginings of their unrighteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>wherein they were led astray to worship irrational reptiles and wretched vermin,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you sent upon them a multitude of irrational creatures to punish them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> that they might learn that by what things a man sins, by these he is punished.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For your all-powerful hand<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that created the world out of formless matter<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>didn’t lack means to send upon them a multitude of bears, fierce lions,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> or newly-created and unknown wild beasts, full of rage,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>either breathing out a blast of fiery breath,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or belching out smoke,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or flashing dreadful sparks from their eyes;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> which had power not only to consume them by their violence,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but to destroy them even by the terror of their sight.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Yes and without these they might have fallen by a single breath,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>being pursued by Justice, and scattered abroad by the breath of your power;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but you arranged all things by measure, number, and weight.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For to be greatly strong is yours at all times.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Who could withstand the might of your arm?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Because the whole world before you is as a grain in a balance,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and as a drop of dew that comes down upon the earth in the morning.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> But you have mercy on all men, because you have power to do all things,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you overlook the sins of men to the end that they may repent.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> For you love all things that are,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and abhor none of the things which you made;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For you never would have formed anything if you hated it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> How would anything have endured unless you had willed it?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or that which was not called by you, how would it have been preserved?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> But you spare all things, because they are yours,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>O Sovereign Lord, you who love the living.</div>
