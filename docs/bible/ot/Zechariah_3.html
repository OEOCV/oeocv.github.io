<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before Yahweh’s angel, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and Yahweh’s angel was standing by.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Yahweh’s angel solomnly assured Joshua, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> “Yahweh of Armies says: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign; for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua: on one stone are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave its inscription,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> In that day,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’”</div>
