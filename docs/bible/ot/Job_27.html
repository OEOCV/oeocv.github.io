<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “As God lives, who has taken away my right,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> (for the length of my life is still in me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> surely my lips will not speak unrighteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither will my tongue utter deceit.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Far be it from me that I should justify you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My heart will not reproach me so long as I live.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> “Let my enemy be as the wicked.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when God takes away his life?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Will he delight himself in the Almighty,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and call on God at all times?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I will teach you about the hand of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will not conceal that which is with the Almighty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>why then have you become altogether vain?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “This is the portion of a wicked man with God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>His offspring will not be satisfied with bread.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Those who remain of him will be buried in death.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>His widows will make no lamentation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Though he heap up silver as the dust,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and prepare clothing as the clay;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> he may prepare it, but the just will put it on,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the innocent will divide the silver.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Terrors overtake him like waters.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>A storm steals him away in the night.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> The east wind carries him away, and he departs.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It sweeps him out of his place.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> For it hurls at him, and does not spare,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as he flees away from his hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Men will clap their hands at him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will hiss him out of his place.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
