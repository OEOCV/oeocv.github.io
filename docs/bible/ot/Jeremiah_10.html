<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Don’t learn the way of the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and don’t be dismayed at the signs of the sky;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the nations are dismayed at them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For the customs of the peoples are vanity;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for one cuts a tree out of the forest,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the work of the hands of the workman with the ax.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> They deck it with silver and with gold.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They fasten it with nails and with hammers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so that it can’t move.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> They are like a palm tree, of turned work,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and don’t speak.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They must be carried,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because they can’t move.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t be afraid of them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they can’t do evil,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither is it in them to do good.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> There is no one like you, Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You are great,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your name is great in might.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Who shouldn’t fear you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>King of the nations?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For it belongs to you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Because among all the wise men of the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in all their royal estate,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>there is no one like you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But they are together brutish and foolish,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>instructed by idols!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It is just wood.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and gold from Uphaz,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the work of the engraver and of the hands of the goldsmith.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their clothing is blue and purple.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are all the work of skillful men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> But Yahweh is the true God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He is the living God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and an everlasting King.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>At his wrath, the earth trembles.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The nations aren’t able to withstand his indignation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “You shall say this to them: ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> God has made the earth by his power.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has established the world by his wisdom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> When he utters his voice,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the waters in the heavens roar,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He makes lightnings for the rain,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and brings the wind out of his treasuries.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> They are vanity, a work of delusion.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>In the time of their visitation they will perish.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> The portion of Jacob is not like these;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he is the maker of all things;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yahweh of Armies is his name.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For Yahweh says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will distress them, that they may feel it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Woe is me because of my injury!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My wound is serious;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but I said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> My tent has been destroyed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all my cords are broken.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My children have gone away from me, and they are no more.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There is no one to spread my tent any more,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to set up my curtains.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For the shepherds have become brutish,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and have not inquired of Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore they have not prospered,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all their flocks have scattered.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> The voice of news, behold, it comes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a great commotion out of the north country,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to make the cities of Judah a desolation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a dwelling place of jackals.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Yahweh, correct me, but gently;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>not in your anger,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>lest you reduce me to nothing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and on the families that don’t call on your name;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they have devoured Jacob.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, they have devoured him, consumed him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and have laid waste his habitation.</div>
