<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in Yahweh. She didn’t draw near to her God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Yahweh, within her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn’t fail, but the unjust know no shame.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction,” so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her. But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “Therefore wait for me”, says Yahweh, “until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh’s name, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out from among you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be arrogant in my holy mountain.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But I will leave among you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh’s name.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is among you. You will not be afraid of evil any more.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Yahweh, your God, is among you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you; and I will save those who are lame and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> At that time I will bring you in, and at that time I will gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh.</div>
