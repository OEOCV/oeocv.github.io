<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now this one endured this praiseworthy death. The third was brought along, and exhorted by many to taste and save his life.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> But he cried out and said, “Don’t you know that the father of those who are dead is my father also, and that the same mother bore me, and that I was brought up in the same way?</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I don’t renounce the noble relationship of my kindred.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Now then, whatever instrument of vengeance you have, apply it to my body, for you aren’t able to touch my soul, even if you want to.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But they, highly incensed at his boldness of speech, dislocated his hands and feet with racking engines, and wrenching them from their sockets, dismembered him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> They dragged around his fingers, his arms, his legs, and his ankles.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Not being able by any means to strangle him, they tore off his skin, together with the extreme tips of his fingers, and then dragged him to the wheel,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> around which his vertebral joints were loosened, and he saw his own flesh torn to shreds, and streams of blood flowing from his entrails.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> When about to die, he said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “We, O accursed tyrant, suffer this for the sake of Divine education and virtue.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> But you, for your impiety and blood shedding, will endure unceasing torments.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Thus having died worthily of his kindred, they dragged forward the fourth, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “Don’t share the madness of your kindred, but respect the king and save yourself.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But he said to them, “You don’t have a fire so scorching as to make me play the coward.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> By the blessed death of my kindred, and the eternal punishment of the tyrant, and the glorious life of the pious, I will not repudiate the noble brotherhood.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Invent, O tyrant, tortures, that you may learn, even through them, that I am the brother of those tormented before.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> When he had said this, the blood-thirsty, murderous, and unholy Antiochus ordered his tongue to be cut out.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But he said, “Even if you take away the organ of speech, God still hears the silent.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Behold, my tongue is extended, cut it off; for in spite of that you won’t silence our reasoning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> We gladly lose our limbs on behalf of God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> But God will speedily find you, since you cut off the tongue, the instrument of divine melody.”</div>
