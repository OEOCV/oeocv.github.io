<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Flee! Save your lives!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Be like the juniper bush in the wilderness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> “Make him drunk,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he magnified himself against Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Moab will wallow in his vomit,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he also will be in derision.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> For wasn’t Israel a derision to you?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Was he found among thieves?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For as often as you speak of him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you shake your head.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> “We have heard of the pride of Moab.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He is very proud in his loftiness, his pride,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>his arrogance, and the arrogance of his heart.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like flutes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and my heart sounds like flutes for the men of Kir Heres.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> For every head is bald,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and every beard clipped.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There are cuttings on all the hands,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and sackcloth on the waist.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> On all the housetops of Moab,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in its streets, there is lamentation everywhere;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one delights,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> Moab will be destroyed from being a people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because he has magnified himself against Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> Terror, the pit, and the snare are on you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>inhabitant of Moab,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> “He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I will bring on him, even on Moab,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> “Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a flame from the middle of Sihon,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and has devoured the corner of Moab,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> Woe to you, O Moab!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The people of Chemosh are undone;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for your sons are taken away captive,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your daughters into captivity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
