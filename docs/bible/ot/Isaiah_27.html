<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan, the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard!</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I, Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> It will happen in that day that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</div>
