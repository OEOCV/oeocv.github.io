<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.</div>

<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</div>

<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Yahweh said to her,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Two nations are in your womb.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Two peoples will be separated from your body.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The one people will be stronger than the other people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The elder will serve the younger.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</div>
