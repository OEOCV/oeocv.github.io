<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> He went on his journeys from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on Yahweh’s name.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves from one other.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> for I will give all the land which you see to you and to your offspring forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.</div>
