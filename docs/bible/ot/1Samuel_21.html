<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The priest answered David, and said, “I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to be replaced with hot bread in the day when it was taken away.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I haven’t brought my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it, for there is no other except that here.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Saul has slain his thousands,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and David his ten thousands?’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> He changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to me?</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?”</div>
