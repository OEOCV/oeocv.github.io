<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Yahweh God said to the serpent,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Because you have done this,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you are cursed above all livestock,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and above every animal of the field.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You shall go on your belly<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> I will put hostility between you and the woman,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and between your offspring and her offspring.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will bruise your head,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you will bruise his heel.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> To Adam he said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and have eaten from the tree,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the ground is cursed for your sake.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for you were taken out of it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For you are dust,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you shall return to dust.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
