<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still locked up in the court of the guard, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it—Yahweh is his name, says:</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> ‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult things, which you don’t know.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword:</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> ‘While men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> behold, I will bring it health and healing, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel, and will build them as at the first.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Yahweh says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, ‘It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for his loving kindness endures forever;’ who bring thanksgiving into Yahweh’s house. For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed as at the first,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of him who counts them,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> “In those days and at that time,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> In those days Judah will be saved,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and Jerusalem will dwell safely.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>This is the name by which she will be called:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yahweh our righteousness.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For Yahweh says: “David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> The Levitical priests won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> “Yahweh says: ‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their time,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> then my covenant could also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levitical priests, my ministers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> “Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has Yahweh cast off the two families which he chose?’ Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Yahweh says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth,</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.”</div>
