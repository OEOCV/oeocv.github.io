<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man’s wife.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</div>
