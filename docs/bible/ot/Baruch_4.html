<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> This is the book of God’s commandments and the law that endures forever. All those who hold it fast will live, but those who leave it will die.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Turn, O Jacob, and take hold of it. Walk toward the shining of its light.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Don’t give your glory to another, nor the things that are to your advantage to a foreign nation.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> O Israel, we are happy; for the things that are pleasing to God are made known to us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> You were not sold to the nations for destruction, but because you moved God to wrath, you were delivered to your adversaries.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For you provoked him who made you by sacrificing to demons and not to God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> You forgot the everlasting God who brought you up. You also grieved Jerusalem, who nursed you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For she saw the wrath that came upon you from God, and said, “Listen, you who dwell near Zion; for God has brought upon me great mourning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For I have seen the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For with joy I nourished them, but sent them away with weeping and mourning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Let no man rejoice over me, a widow and forsaken by many. For the sins of my children, I am left desolate, because they turned away from the law of God</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> and had no regard for his statutes. They didn’t walk in the ways of God’s commandments or tread in the paths of discipline in his righteousness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Let those who dwell near Zion come and remember the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For he has brought a nation upon them from afar, a shameless nation with a strange language, who didn’t respect old men or pity children.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> They have carried away the dear beloved sons of the widow, and left her who was alone desolate of her daughters.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But I—how can I help you?</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For he who brought these calamities upon you will deliver you from the hand of your enemies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Go your way, O my children. Go your way, for I am left desolate.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> I have put off the garment of peace, and put on the sackcloth of my petition. I will cry to the Everlasting as long as I live.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Take courage, my children. Cry to God, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> For I have trusted in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy has come to me from the Holy One, because of the mercy that will soon come to you from your Everlasting Savior.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For I sent you out with mourning and weeping, but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> For as now those who dwell near Zion have seen your captivity, so they will shortly see your salvation from our God which will come upon you with great glory and brightness of the Everlasting.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> My children, suffer patiently the wrath that has come upon you from God, for your enemy has persecuted you; but shortly you will see his destruction and will tread upon their necks.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> My delicate ones have traveled rough roads. They were taken away like a flock carried off by enemies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Take courage, my children, and cry to God; for you will be remembered by him who has brought this upon you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> For as it was your decision to go astray from God, return and seek him ten times more.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> For he who brought these calamities upon you will bring you everlasting joy again with your salvation.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Take courage, O Jerusalem, for he who called you by name will comfort you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Miserable are those who afflicted you and rejoiced at your fall.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Miserable are the cities which your children served. Miserable is she who received your sons.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> For as she rejoiced at your fall and was glad of your ruin, so she will be grieved at her own desolation.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> And I will take away her pride in her great multitude and her boasting will be turned into mourning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> For fire will come upon her from the Everlasting for many days; and she will be inhabited by demons for a long time.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> O Jerusalem, look around you toward the east, and behold the joy that comes to you from God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Behold, your sons come, whom you sent away. They come gathered together from the east to the west at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.</div>
