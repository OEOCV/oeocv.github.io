<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For my hand has made all these things,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and so all these things came to be,” says Yahweh:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“but I will look to this man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even to he who is poor and of a contrite spirit,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and who trembles at my word.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog’s neck;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig’s blood;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, they have chosen their own ways,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their soul delights in their abominations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I also will choose their delusions,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will bring their fears on them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because when I called, no one answered;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when I spoke, they didn’t listen,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but they did that which was evil in my eyes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> A voice of tumult from the city,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a voice from the temple,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a voice of Yahweh that repays his enemies what they deserve.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
