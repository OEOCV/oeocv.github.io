<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> “But if a man is just,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and does that which is lawful and right,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he will die in his iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> “Yet you say, ‘Why doesn’t the son bear the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he will surely live.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> The soul who sins, he shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die.</div>

<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?” says the Lord Yahweh, “and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> “But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, should he live?

<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not equal.’ Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren’t your ways unequal?</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in it, then he dies in his iniquity that he has done.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he will save his soul alive.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shall not die.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ House of Israel, aren’t my ways fair? Aren’t your ways unfair?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> “Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Return, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions, so iniquity will not be your ruin.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Cast away from you all your transgressions in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit. For why will you die, house of Israel?</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Therefore turn yourselves, and live!</div>
