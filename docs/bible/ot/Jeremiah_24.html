<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before Yahweh’s temple, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Then Yahweh asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I said, “Figs. The good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so bad that they can’t be eaten.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, as good.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land. I will build them, and not pull them down. I will plant them, and not pluck them up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh. They will be my people, and I will be their God; for they will return to me with their whole heart.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “‘As the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so bad,’ surely Yahweh says, ‘So I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I will drive them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.’”</div>
