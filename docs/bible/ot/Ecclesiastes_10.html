<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odor;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> A wise man’s heart is at his right hand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but a fool’s heart at his left.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Yes also when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered by it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> If the ax is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> A fool also multiplies words.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Woe to you, land, when your king is a child,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your princes eat in the morning!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your princes eat in due season,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for strength, and not for drunkenness!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> By slothfulness the roof sinks in;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> A feast is made for laughter,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and wine makes the life glad;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and money is the answer for all things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for a bird of the sky may carry your voice,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and that which has wings may tell the matter.</div>
