<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Oh that I knew where I might find him!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>That I might come even to his seat!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I would set my cause in order before him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and fill my mouth with arguments.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I would know the words which he would answer me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and understand what he would tell me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>No, but he would listen to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> There the upright might reason with him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so I should be delivered forever from my judge.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “If I go east, he is not there.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>If I go west, I can’t find him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He works to the north, but I can’t see him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> But he knows the way that I take.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>When he has tried me, I will come out like gold.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> My foot has held fast to his steps.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have kept his way, and not turned away.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>What his soul desires, even that he does.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For he performs that which is appointed for me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Many such things are with him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Therefore I am terrified at his presence.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>When I consider, I am afraid of him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> For God has made my heart faint.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The Almighty has terrified me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Because I was not cut off before the darkness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
