<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Speak and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the great monster that lies in the middle of his rivers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that has said, ‘My river is my own,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I have made it for myself.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I will put hooks in your jaws,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will bring you up out of the middle of your rivers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I’ll cast you out into the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you and all the fish of your rivers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You’ll fall on the open field.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You won’t be brought together or gathered.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I have given you for food to the animals of the earth<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and to the birds of the sky.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “‘“All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke and tore all their shoulders. When they leaned on you, you broke and paralyzed all of their thighs.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off man and animal from you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The land of Egypt will be a desolation and a waste. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“‘“Because he has said, ‘The river is mine, and I have made it,’</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> therefore, behold, I am against you and against your rivers. I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> No foot of man will pass through it, nor will any animal foot pass through it. It won’t be inhabited for forty years.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the middle of the countries that are desolate. Her cities among the cities that are laid waste will be a desolation forty years. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “‘For the Lord Yahweh says: “At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I will reverse the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth. There they will be a lowly kingdom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> It will be the lowest of the kingdoms. It won’t lift itself up above the nations any more. I will diminish them so that they will no longer rule over the nations.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> It will no longer be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after them. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.”’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> It came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> “Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre. Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet he had no wages, nor did his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He will carry off her multitude, take her plunder, and take her prey. That will be the wages for his army.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he served, because they worked for me,’ says the Lord Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “In that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”</div>
