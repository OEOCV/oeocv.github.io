<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Then I went down to the potter’s house, and behold, he was making something on the wheels.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “House of Israel, can’t I do with you as this potter?” says Yahweh. “Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, house of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good with which I said I would benefit them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a plan against you. Everyone return from his evil way now, and amend your ways and your doings.”’</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But they say, ‘It is in vain; for we will walk after our own plans, and we will each follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Ask now among the nations,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Who has heard such things?’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Will the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Will the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For my people have forgotten me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They have burned incense to false gods.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They have been made to stumble in their ways<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the ancient paths,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to walk in byways, in a way not built up,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> to make their land an astonishment,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a perpetual hissing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Everyone who passes by it will be astonished,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and shake his head.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will show them the back, and not the face,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the day of their calamity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Then they said, “Come! Let’s devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law won’t perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let’s strike him with the tongue, and let’s not give heed to any of his words.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Give heed to me, Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Should evil be recompensed for good?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For they have dug a pit for my soul.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to turn away your wrath from them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Therefore deliver up their children to the famine,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and give them over to the power of the sword.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let their wives become childless and widows.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let their men be killed<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their young men struck by the sword in battle.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Let a cry be heard from their houses<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when you bring a troop suddenly on them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they have dug a pit to take me<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and hidden snares for my feet.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Yet, Yahweh, you know all their counsel against me to kill me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t forgive their iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t blot out their sin from your sight,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let them be overthrown before you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Deal with them in the time of your anger.</div>
