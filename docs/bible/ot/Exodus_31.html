<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Behold, I myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> the table and its vessels, the pure lamp stand with all its vessels, the altar of incense,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> the finely worked garments—the holy garments for Aaron the priest, the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office—</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths; for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> When he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the covenant, stone tablets, written with God’s finger.</div>
