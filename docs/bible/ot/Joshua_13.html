<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now Joshua was old and well advanced in years. Yahweh said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, which is counted as Canaanite; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians. I will drive them out from before the children of Israel. Just allocate it to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (who was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these, and drove them out.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Nevertheless the children of Israel didn’t drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath live within Israel to this day.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,</div>

<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> The children of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among the rest of their slain.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> The border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and its villages.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad, according to their families.</div>
