<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and preach toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Tell the land of Israel, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, and will draw my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword will go out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> All flesh will know that I, Yahweh, have drawn my sword out of its sheath. It will not return any more.”’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “Therefore sigh, you son of man. You shall sigh before their eyes with a broken heart<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and with bitterness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> It shall be, when they ask you, ‘Why do you sigh?’ that you shall say, ‘Because of the news, for it comes! Every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> “Son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘Yahweh says:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“A sword! A sword!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It is sharpened,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and also polished.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> It is sharpened that it may make a slaughter.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It is polished that it may be as lightning.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Should we then make mirth?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The rod of my son condemns every tree.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> It is given to be polished,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that it may be handled.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The sword is sharpened.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, it is polished<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to give it into the hand of the killer.”’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Cry and wail, son of man;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for it is on my people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It is on all the princes of Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are delivered over to the sword with my people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore beat your thigh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “For there is a trial. What if even the rod that condemns will be no more?” says the Lord Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Gather yourselves together.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Go to the right.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Set yourselves in array.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Go to the left,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>wherever your face is set.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> “Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. They both will come out of one land, and mark out a place. Mark it out at the head of the way to the city.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook the arrows back and forth. He consulted the teraphim.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> He looked in the liver.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> In his right hand was the lot for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, and to build forts.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> It will be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory, that they may be taken.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you have caused your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to memory, you will be taken with the hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> “‘You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> the Lord Yahweh says: “Remove the turban, and take off the crown. This will not be as it was. Exalt that which is low, and humble that which is high.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> I will overturn, overturn, overturn it. This also will be no more, until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it.”’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> “You, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“A sword! A sword is drawn!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It is polished for the slaughter,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to cause it to devour,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that it may be as lightning;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> while they see for you false visions,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>while they divine lies to you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Cause it to return into its sheath.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>In the place where you were created,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the land of your birth, I will judge you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> I will pour out my indignation on you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>skillful to destroy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> You will be for fuel to the fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Your blood will be in the middle of the land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You will be remembered no more;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.”’”</div>
