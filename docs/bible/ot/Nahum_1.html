<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>The Book of Nahum</h2><span class="vn">1</span> A revelation about Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> is a jealous God<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> and avenges. Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath. Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he maintains wrath against his enemies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel languish. The flower of Lebanon languishes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and all who dwell in it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> What do you plot against Yahweh? He will make a full end. Affliction won’t rise up the second time.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly like dry stubble.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> One has gone out of you who devises evil against Yahweh, who counsels wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yahweh says: “Though they are in full strength and likewise many, even so they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Now I will break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds apart.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Yahweh has commanded concerning you: “No more descendants will bear your name. Out of the house of your gods, I will cut off the engraved image and the molten image. I will make your grave, for you are vile.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep your feasts, Judah! Perform your vows, for the wicked one will no more pass through you. He is utterly cut off.</div>
