<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Again, one preparing to sail, and about to journey over raging waves,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the vessel that carries him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For the hunger for profit planned it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and wisdom was the craftsman who built it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Your providence, O Father, guides it along,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because even in the sea you gave a way,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in the waves a sure path,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> showing that you can save out of every danger,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that even a man without skill may put to sea.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> It is your will that the works of your wisdom should not be ineffective.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore men also entrust their lives to a little piece of wood,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and passing through the surge on a raft come safely to land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> in the old time also, when proud giants were perishing,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the hope of the world, taking refuge on a raft,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>your hand guided the seed of generations of the race of men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For blessed is wood through which comes righteousness;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> but the idol made with hands is accursed, itself and he that made it;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because his was the working, and the corruptible thing was called a god.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For both the ungodly and his ungodliness are alike hateful to God;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> for truly the deed will be punished together with him who committed it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Therefore also there will be a visitation among the idols of the nation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because, though formed of things which God created, they were made an abomination,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>stumbling blocks to the souls of men,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a snare to the feet of the foolish.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For the devising of idols was the beginning of fornication,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the invention of them the corruption of life.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For they didn’t exist from the beginning, and they won’t exist forever.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For by the boastfulness of men they entered into the world,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and therefore a speedy end was planned for them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For a father worn with untimely grief,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>making an image of the child quickly taken away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>now honored him as a god which was then a dead human being,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and delivered to those that were under him mysteries and solemn rites.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Afterward the ungodly custom, in process of time grown strong, was kept as a law,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the engraved images received worship by the commandments of princes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> And when men could not honor them in presence because they lived far off,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>imagining the likeness from afar,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they made a visible image of the king whom they honored,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that by their zeal they might flatter the absent as if present.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But worship was raised to a yet higher pitch, even by those who didn’t know him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>urged forward by the ambition of the architect;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> for he, wishing perhaps to please his ruler,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>used his art to force the likeness toward a greater beauty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> So the multitude, allured by reason of the grace of his handiwork,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>now consider an object of devotion him that a little before was honored as a man.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> And this became an ambush,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because men, in bondage either to calamity or to tyranny,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>invested stones and stocks with the Name that shouldn’t be shared.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Afterward it was not enough for them to go astray concerning the knowledge of God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but also, while they live in a great war of ignorance, they call a multitude of evils peace.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For either slaughtering children in solemn rites, or celebrating secret mysteries,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or holding frenzied revels of strange customs,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> no longer do they guard either life or purity of marriage,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but one brings upon another either death by treachery, or anguish by adultery.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> And all things confusedly are filled with blood and murder, theft and deceit,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> confusion about what is good, forgetfulness of favors,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>ingratitude for benefits,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>defiling of souls, confusion of sex,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>disorder in marriage, adultery and wantonness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> For the worship of idols that may not be named <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>is a beginning and cause and end of every evil.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> For their worshipers either make merry to madness, or prophesy lies,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or live unrighteously, or lightly commit perjury.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> For putting their trust in lifeless idols,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when they have sworn a wicked oath, they expect not to suffer harm.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> But on both counts, the just doom will pursue them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because they had evil thoughts of God by giving heed to idols,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and swore unrighteously in deceit through contempt for holiness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> For it is not the power of things by which men swear,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but it is the just penalty for those who sin<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that always visits the transgression of the unrighteous.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
