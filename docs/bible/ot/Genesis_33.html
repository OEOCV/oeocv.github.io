<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Jacob said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Esau said, “Let’s take our journey, and let’s go, and I will go before you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></div>
