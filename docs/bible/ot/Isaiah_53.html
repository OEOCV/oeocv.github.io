<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Surely he has borne our sickness<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and carried our suffering;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet we considered him plagued,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>struck by God, and afflicted.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But he was pierced for our transgressions.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He was crushed for our iniquities.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The punishment that brought our peace was on him;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and by his wounds we are healed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
