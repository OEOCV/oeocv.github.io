<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh said to me, “Go, and buy yourself a linen belt, and put it on your waist, and don’t put it in water.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> So I bought a belt according to Yahweh’s word, and put it on my waist.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> “Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> After many days, Yahweh said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which I commanded you to hide there.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was ruined. It was profitable for nothing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> “Yahweh says, ‘In this way I will ruin the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have gone after other gods to serve them and to worship them, will even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to me,’ says Yahweh; ‘that they may be to me for a people, for a name, for praise, and for glory; but they would not hear.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> “Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says, “Every container should be filled with wine.”’ They will tell you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every container should be filled with wine?’</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then tell them, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together,” says Yahweh: “I will not pity, spare, or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.”’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Hear, and give ear.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t be proud,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for Yahweh has spoken.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Give glory to Yahweh your God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>before he causes darkness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and while you look for light,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he turns it into the shadow of death,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and makes it deep darkness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But if you will not hear it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>my soul will weep in secret for your pride.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My eye will weep bitterly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and run down with tears,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because Yahweh’s flock has been taken captive.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Say to the king and to the queen mother,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Humble yourselves.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Sit down, for your crowns have come down,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even the crown of your glory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> The cities of the South are shut up,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and there is no one to open them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Judah is carried away captive: all of them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are wholly carried away captive.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Lift up your eyes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and see those who come from the north.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Where is the flock that was given to you,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>your beautiful flock?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> What will you say when he sets over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Won’t sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> If you say in your heart,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Why have these things come on me?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Your skirts are uncovered because of the greatness of your iniquity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your heels suffer violence.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Can the Ethiopian change his skin,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or the leopard his spots?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Then may you also do good,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who are accustomed to do evil.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> “Therefore I will scatter them<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as the stubble that passes away<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>by the wind of the wilderness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> This is your lot,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the portion measured to you from me,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“because you have forgotten me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and trusted in falsehood.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Therefore I will also uncover your skirts on your face,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your shame will appear.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>on the hills in the field.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Woe to you, Jerusalem!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You will not be made clean.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>How long will it yet be?”</div>
