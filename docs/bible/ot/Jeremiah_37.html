<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to Yahweh’s words, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people, for they had not put him into prison.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, will return to Egypt into their own land.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> The Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city. They will take it and burn it with fire.”’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> “Yahweh says, ‘Don’t deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us;” for they will not depart.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and only wounded men remained among them, they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> When the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> then Zedekiah the king sent and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land?’</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’|strong="H644" street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</div>
