<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> For truly all men who had no perception of God were foolish by nature,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and didn’t gain power to know him who exists from the good things that are seen.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They didn’t recognize the architect from his works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> But they thought that either fire, or wind, or swift air,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or circling stars, or raging water, or luminaries of heaven<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>were gods that rule the world.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> If it was through delight in their beauty that they took them to be gods,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>let them know how much better their Sovereign Lord is than these,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the first author of beauty created them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But if it was through astonishment at their power and influence,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>then let them understand from them how much more powerful he who formed them is.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For from the greatness of the beauty of created things,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>mankind forms the corresponding perception of their Maker.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But yet for these men there is but small blame,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they too perhaps go astray<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>while they are seeking God and desiring to find him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For they diligently search while living among his works,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they trust their sight that the things that they look at are beautiful.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But again even they are not to be excused.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For if they had power to know so much,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that they should be able to explore the world,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>how is it that they didn’t find the Sovereign Lord sooner?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> But they were miserable, and their hopes were in dead things,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who called them gods which are works of men’s hands,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>gold and silver, skillfully made, and likenesses of animals,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Yes and some<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> woodcutter might saw down a tree that is easily moved,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>skillfully strip away all its bark,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and fashion it in attractive form, make a useful vessel to serve his life’s needs.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Burning the scraps from his handiwork to cook his food,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he eats his fill.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Taking a discarded scrap which served no purpose,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a crooked piece of wood and full of knots,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he carves it with the diligence of his idleness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and shapes it by the skill of his idleness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He shapes it in the image of a man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> or makes it like some worthless animal,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>smearing it with something red, painting it red,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and smearing over every stain in it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Having made a worthy chamber for it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he sets it in a wall, securing it with iron.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> He plans for it that it may not fall down,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>knowing that it is unable to help itself<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>(for truly it is an image, and needs help).<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> When he makes his prayer concerning goods and his marriage and children,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he is not ashamed to speak to that which has no life.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Yes, for health, he calls upon that which is weak.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For life, he implores that which is dead.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For aid, he supplicates that which has no experience.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For a good journey, he asks that which can’t so much as move a step.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> And for profit in business and good success of his hands,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he asks ability from that which has hands with no ability.</div>
