<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> “‘I will have respect for you, make you fruitful, multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> You shall eat old supplies long kept, and you shall move out the old because of the new.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I will set my tent among you, and my soul won’t abhor you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you walk upright.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> “‘But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments,</div>

<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation. I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies who dwell in it will be astonished at it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you. Your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</div>

<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> “‘As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword. They will fall when no one pursues.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues. You will have no power to stand before your enemies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> You will perish among the nations. The land of your enemies will eat you up.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away with them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> “‘If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me; and also that because they walked contrary to me,</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity,</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham; and I will remember the land.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> But I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.</div>
