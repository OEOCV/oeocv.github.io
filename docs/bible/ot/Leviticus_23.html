<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, there shall be a solemn rest for you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.</div>

<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> “‘These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day—</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> in addition to the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and in addition to your gifts, and in addition to all your vows, and in addition to all your free will offerings, which you give to Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> “‘So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> You shall take on the first day the fruit of majestic trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations. You shall keep it in the seventh month.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> You shall dwell in temporary shelters<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> for seven days. All who are native-born in Israel shall dwell in temporary shelters,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in temporary shelters<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.
