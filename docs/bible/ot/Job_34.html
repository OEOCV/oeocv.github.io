<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Hear my words, you wise men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For the ear tries words,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as the palate tastes food.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Let us choose for us that which is right.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let us know among ourselves what is good.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>God has taken away my right.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> What man is like Job,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who drinks scorn like water,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and walks with wicked men?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that he should delight himself with God.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For the work of a man he will render to him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and cause every man to find according to his ways.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither will the Almighty pervert justice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Who put him in charge of the earth?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or who has appointed him over the whole world?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> If he set his heart on himself,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> all flesh would perish together,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and man would turn again to dust.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> “If now you have understanding, hear this.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Listen to the voice of my words.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Should even one who hates justice govern?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> who says to a king, ‘Vile!’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> He doesn’t respect the persons of princes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor respect the rich more than the poor,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they all are the work of his hands.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> In a moment they die, even at midnight.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The people are shaken and pass away.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The mighty are taken away without a hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “For his eyes are on the ways of a man.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He sees all his goings.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that he should go before God in judgment.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and sets others in their place.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> He strikes them as wicked men<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the open sight of others;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> because they turned away from following him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He heard the cry of the afflicted.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>When he hides his face, who then can see him?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He is over a nation or a man alike,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> that the godless man may not reign,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that there be no one to ensnare the people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> “For has any said to God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Teach me that which I don’t see.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For you must choose, and not I.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore speak what you know.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Men of understanding will tell me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yes, every wise man who hears me:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> ‘Job speaks without knowledge.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>His words are without wisdom.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> I wish that Job were tried to the end,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because of his answering like wicked men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> For he adds rebellion to his sin.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He claps his hands among us,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and multiplies his words against God.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
