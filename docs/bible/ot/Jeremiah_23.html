<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” says Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says against the shepherds who feed my people: “You have scattered my flock, driven them away, and have not visited them. Behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings,” says Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> “I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they will be fruitful and multiply.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, neither will any be lacking,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“that I will raise to David a righteous Branch;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he will reign as king and deal wisely,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> In his days Judah will be saved,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and Israel will dwell safely.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>This is his name by which he will be called:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yahweh our righteousness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> “Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that they will no more say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> but, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will dwell in their own land.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Concerning the prophets:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My heart within me is broken.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>All my bones shake.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I am like a drunken man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and like a man whom wine has overcome,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because of Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and because of his holy words.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “For the land is full of adulterers;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for because of the curse the land mourns.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their course is evil,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their might is not right;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> for both prophet and priest are profane.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, in my house I have found their wickedness,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will be driven on,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and fall therein;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I will bring evil on them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>even the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They prophesied by Baal,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and caused my people Israel to err.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> In the prophets of Jerusalem I have also seen a horrible thing:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they commit adultery and walk in lies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They strengthen the hands of evildoers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so that no one returns from his wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They have all become to me as Sodom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Therefore Yahweh of Armies says concerning the prophets:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and make them drink poisoned water;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Yahweh of Armies says,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They teach you vanity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They speak a vision of their own heart,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> They say continually to those who despise me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘Yahweh has said, “You will have peace;”’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>‘No evil will come on you.’<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For who has stood in the council of Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that he should perceive and hear his word?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Who has listened to my word, and heard it?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, a whirling storm!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It will burst on the head of the wicked.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Yahweh’s anger will not return until he has executed<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and performed the intents of his heart.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>In the latter days, you will understand it perfectly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> I didn’t send these prophets, yet they ran.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I didn’t speak to them, yet they prophesied.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But if they had stood in my council,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>then they would have caused my people to hear my words,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and would have turned them from their evil way,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and from the evil of their doings.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> “Am I a God at hand,” says Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“and not a God afar off?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Can anyone hide himself in secret places<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so that I can’t see him?” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Don’t I fill heaven and earth?” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> “I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> They intend to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they each tell his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name because of Baal.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat?” says Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> “Isn’t my word like fire?” says Yahweh; “and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> “Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who each steal my words from his neighbor.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who use their tongues, and say, ‘He says.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,” says Yahweh, “who tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting; yet I didn’t send them or command them. They don’t profit this people at all,” says Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> “When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the message from Yahweh?’ Then you shall tell them, ‘“What message? I will cast you off,” says Yahweh.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> As for the prophet, the priest, and the people, who say, ‘The message from Yahweh,’ I will even punish that man and his household.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> You will say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, ‘What has Yahweh answered?’ and, ‘What has Yahweh said?’</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> You will mention the message from Yahweh no more, for every man’s own word has become his message; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of Yahweh of Armies, our God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> You will say to the prophet, ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ and, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> Although you say, ‘The message from Yahweh,’ therefore Yahweh says: ‘Because you say this word, “The message from Yahweh,” and I have sent to you, telling you not to say, “The message from Yahweh,”</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> therefore behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off with the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.’”</div>
