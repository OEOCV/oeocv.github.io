<div class="v" id="v1"><h2>The Second Book of Samuel</h2><span class="vn">1</span> After the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> on the third day, behold,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn and earth on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the earth and showed respect.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> David said to him, “Where do you come from?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said to him, “I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> David said to him, “How did it go? Please tell me.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead. Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> The young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed close behind him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. I answered, ‘Here I am.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He said to me, ‘Please stand beside me, and kill me, for anguish has taken hold of me because my life lingers in me.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Then David took hold on his clothes and tore them; and all the men who were with him did likewise.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> David said to him, “Why were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh’s anointed?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> David called one of the young men and said, “Go near, and cut him down!” He struck him so that he died.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> David said to him, “Your blood be on your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have slain Yahweh’s anointed.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> (and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> “Your glory, Israel, was slain on your high places!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>How the mighty have fallen!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Don’t tell it in Gath.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Don’t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> You mountains of Gilboa,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>let there be no dew or rain on you, and no fields of offerings;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For there the shield of the mighty was defiled and cast away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> From the blood of the slain,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>from the fat of the mighty,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Jonathan’s bow didn’t turn back.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Saul’s sword didn’t return empty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>In their death, they were not divided.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They were swifter than eagles.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They were stronger than lions.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who clothed you delicately in scarlet,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> How the mighty have fallen in the middle of the battle!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Jonathan was slain on your high places.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You have been very pleasant to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Your love to me was wonderful,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>surpassing the love of women.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> How the mighty have fallen,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the weapons of war have perished!”</div>
