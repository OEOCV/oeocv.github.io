<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> After these things Yahweh’s word came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Abram said, “Lord<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Abram said, “Behold, you have given no children to me: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Yahweh brought him outside, and said, “Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He said to Abram, “So your offspring will be.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> He believed in Yahweh, who credited it to him for righteousness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He said to Abram, “I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He said, “Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth;</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I have given this land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”</div>
