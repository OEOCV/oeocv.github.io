<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> It was a handbreadth thick. Its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand and five on the left, to wash in them. The things that belonged to the burnt offering were washed in them, but the sea was for the priests to wash in.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He made the ten lamp stands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left.</div>

<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>So Huram finished doing the work that he did for King Solomon in God’s house:</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks—two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> He also made the bases, and he made the basins on the bases—</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.</div>

<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, so that the weight of the bronze could not be determined.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Solomon made all the vessels that were in God’s house: the golden altar, the tables with the show bread on them,</div>
