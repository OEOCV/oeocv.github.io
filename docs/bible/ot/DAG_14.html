<div class="v" id="v1"><h6 class="depth-5">Bel and the Dragon</h6><span class="vn">1</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>King Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus the Persian received his kingdom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Daniel lived with the king, and was honored above all his friends.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day twelve great measures of fine flour, forty sheep, and six firkins<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> of wine were spent on it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The king honored it and went daily to worship it; but Daniel worshiped his own God. The king said to him, “Why don’t you worship Bel?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> He said, “Because I may not honor idols made with hands, but only the living God, who has created the sky and the earth, and has sovereignty over all flesh.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Then the king said to him, “Don’t you think that Bel is a living god? Don’t you see how much he eats and drinks every day?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Then Daniel laughed, and said, “O king, don’t be deceived; for this is just clay inside, and brass outside, and never ate or drank anything.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> So the king was angry, and called for his priests, and said to them, “If you don’t tell me who this is who devours these expenses, you shall die.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> But if you can show me that Bel devours them, then Daniel shall die; for he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Daniel said to the king, “Let it be according to your word.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. The king went with Daniel into Bel’s temple.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> So Bel’s priests said, “Behold, we will leave; but you, O king, set out the food, and mix the wine and set it out, shut the door securely, and seal it with your own signet.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> When you come in the morning, if you don’t find that Bel has eaten everything, we will suffer death, or else Daniel, who speaks falsely against us.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> They weren’t concerned, for under the table they had made a secret entrance, by which they entered in continually, and consumed those things.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> It happened, when they had gone out, the king set the food before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them all over the temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door, sealed it with the king’s signet, and so departed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Now in the night, the priests came with their wives and children, as they usually did, and ate and drank it all.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> In the morning, the king arose, and Daniel with him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> The king said, “Daniel, are the seals whole?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said, “Yes, O king, they are whole.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked at the table, and cried with a loud voice, “You are great, O Bel, and with you is no deceit at all!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Then Daniel laughed, and held the king that he should not go in, and said, “Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps these are.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> The king said, “I see the footsteps of men, women, and children.” Then the king was angry,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> and took the priests with their wives and children, who showed him the secret doors, where they came in and consumed the things that were on the table.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Therefore the king killed them, and delivered Bel into Daniel’s power, who overthrew it and its temple.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> In that same place there was a great dragon which the people of Babylon worshiped.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> The king said to Daniel, “Will you also say that this is of brass? Behold, he lives, eats and drinks. You can’t say that he is no living god. Therefore worship him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Then Daniel said, “I will worship the Lord my God; for he is a living God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> But allow me, O king, and I will kill this dragon without sword or staff.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The king said, “I allow you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and melted them together, and made lumps of them. He put these in the dragon’s mouth, so the dragon ate and burst apart. Daniel said, “Behold, these are the gods you all worship.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> When the people of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, “The king has become a Jew. He has pulled down Bel, slain the dragon, and put the priests to the sword.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> So they came to the king, and said, “Deliver Daniel to us, or else we will destroy you and your house.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Now when the king saw that they trapped him, being constrained, the king delivered Daniel to them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> They cast him into the lion’s den, where he was six days.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> There were seven lions in the den, and they had been giving them two carcasses and two sheep every day, which then were not given to them, intending that they would devour Daniel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Now there was in Jewry the prophet Habakkuk,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> who had made stew, and had broken bread into a bowl. He was going into the field to bring it to the reapers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> But the angel of the Lord said to Habakkuk, “Go carry the dinner that you have into Babylon to Daniel, in the lions’ den.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> Habakkuk said, “Lord, I never saw Babylon. I don’t know where the den is.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and lifted him up by the hair of his head, and with the blast of his breath set him in Babylon over the den.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Habakkuk cried, saying, “O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God has sent you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> Daniel said, “You have remembered me, O God! You haven’t forsaken those who love you!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> So Daniel arose and ate; and the angel of God set Habakkuk in his own place again immediately.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> On the seventh day, the king came to mourn for Daniel. When he came to the den, he looked in, and, behold, Daniel was sitting.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> Then the king cried with a loud voice, saying, “Great are you, O Lord, you God of Daniel, and there is none other beside you!”</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> So he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den; and they were devoured in a moment before his face.</div>
