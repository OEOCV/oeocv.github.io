<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They answered him, “May Yahweh bless you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Boaz answered her, “I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of barley.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not abandoned his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</div>
