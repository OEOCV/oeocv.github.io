<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will utter dark sayings of old,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> which we have heard and known,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and our fathers have told us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> We will not hide them from their children,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For he established a covenant in Jacob,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and appointed a teaching in Israel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>which he commanded our fathers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that they should make them known to their children;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who should arise and tell their children,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> that they might set their hope in God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and not forget God’s deeds,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but keep his commandments,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> and might not be as their fathers—<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a stubborn and rebellious generation,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>whose spirit was not steadfast with God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>turned back in the day of battle.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> They didn’t keep God’s covenant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and refused to walk in his law.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> They forgot his doings,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He made the waters stand as a heap.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all night with a light of fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> He split rocks in the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> He brought streams also out of the rock,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and caused waters to run down like rivers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Yet they still went on to sin against him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> They tempted God in their heart<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>by asking food according to their desire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Yes, they spoke against God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and streams overflowed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Can he give bread also?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Will he provide meat for his people?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>A fire was kindled against Jacob,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>anger also went up against Israel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> because they didn’t believe in God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and didn’t trust in his salvation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Yet he commanded the skies above,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and opened the doors of heaven.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> He rained down manna on them to eat,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and gave them food from the sky.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Man ate the bread of angels.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He sent them food to the full.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>By his power he guided the south wind.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> He also rained meat on them as the dust,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>winged birds as the sand of the seas.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> He let them fall in the middle of their camp,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>around their habitations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> So they ate, and were well filled.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He gave them their own desire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> They didn’t turn from their cravings.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their food was yet in their mouths,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> when the anger of God went up against them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>killed some of their strongest,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and struck down the young men of Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> For all this they still sinned,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their years in terror.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> When he killed them, then they inquired after him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They returned and sought God earnestly.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> They remembered that God was their rock,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the Most High God, their redeemer.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> But they flattered him with their mouth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and lied to him with their tongue.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> For their heart was not right with him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither were they faithful in his covenant.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, many times he turned his anger away,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and didn’t stir up all his wrath.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> He remembered that they were but flesh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and grieved him in the desert!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> They turned again and tempted God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> They didn’t remember his hand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> how he set his signs in Egypt,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>his wonders in the field of Zoan,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> he turned their rivers into blood,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their streams, so that they could not drink.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and frogs, which destroyed them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their labor to the locust.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>their sycamore fig trees with frost.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> He also gave over their livestock to the hail,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>wrath, indignation, and trouble,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a band of angels of evil.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> He made a path for his anger.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He didn’t spare their soul from death,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but gave their life over to the pestilence,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> But he led out his own people like sheep,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v54"><span class="vn">54</span> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v55"><span class="vn">55</span> He also drove out the nations before them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>allotted them for an inheritance by line,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v56"><span class="vn">56</span> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and didn’t keep his testimonies,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v57"><span class="vn">57</span> but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They were twisted like a deceitful bow.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v58"><span class="vn">58</span> For they provoked him to anger with their high places,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v59"><span class="vn">59</span> When God heard this, he was angry,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and greatly abhorred Israel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v60"><span class="vn">60</span> so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the tent which he placed among men,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v61"><span class="vn">61</span> and delivered his strength into captivity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>his glory into the adversary’s hand.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v62"><span class="vn">62</span> He also gave his people over to the sword,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and was angry with his inheritance.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v63"><span class="vn">63</span> Fire devoured their young men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their virgins had no wedding song.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v64"><span class="vn">64</span> Their priests fell by the sword,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their widows couldn’t weep.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v65"><span class="vn">65</span> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v66"><span class="vn">66</span> He struck his adversaries backward.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He put them to a perpetual reproach.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v67"><span class="vn">67</span> Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v68"><span class="vn">68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Mount Zion which he loved.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v69"><span class="vn">69</span> He built his sanctuary like the heights,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>like the earth which he has established forever.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v70"><span class="vn">70</span> He also chose David his servant,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and took him from the sheepfolds;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v71"><span class="vn">71</span> from following the ewes that have their young,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and Israel, his inheritance.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v72"><span class="vn">72</span> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
