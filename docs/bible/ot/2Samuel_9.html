<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> David said, “Is there yet any who is left of Saul’s house, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> There was of Saul’s house a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said, “I am your servant.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> The king said, “Is there not yet any of Saul’s house, that I may show the kindness of God to him?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Ziba said to the king, “Jonathan still has a son, who is lame in his feet.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The king said to him, “Where is he?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, “Mephibosheth?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He answered, “Behold, your servant!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> David said to him, “Don’t be afraid, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You will eat bread at my table continually.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He bowed down, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look at such a dead dog as I am?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s son.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Till the land for him—you, your sons, and your servants. Bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth your master’s son will always eat bread at my table.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table like one of the king’s sons.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All who lived in Ziba’s house were servants to Mephibosheth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate continually at the king’s table. He was lame in both his feet.</div>
