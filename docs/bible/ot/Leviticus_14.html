<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and the priest shall go out of the camp. The priest shall examine him. Behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> then the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> As for the living bird, he shall take it, the cedar wood, the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He shall sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird go into the open field.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean. After that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> It shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair. He shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his body in water. Then he shall be clean.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without defect, one ewe lamb a year old without defect, three tenths of an ephah<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, and one log<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> of oil.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> The priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed, and those things, before Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of Meeting.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> “The priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer him for a trespass offering, with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> He shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass offering. It is most holy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.</div>

<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> then the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal offering on the altar. The priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> “If he is poor, and can’t afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth of an ephah<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering, and a log<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> of oil;</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to afford; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to afford the sacrifice for his cleansing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> “When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put a spreading mildew in a house in the land of your possession,</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, ‘There seems to me to be some sort of plague in the house.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> The priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes in to examine the plague, that all that is in the house not be made unclean. Afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall,</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house,</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> He shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over. They shall pour out the mortar that they scraped off outside of the city into an unclean place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> “If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it was plastered,</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house’s mortar. He shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> “Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> He who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> “If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold, the plague hasn’t spread in the house, after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> To cleanse the house he shall take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.</div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> He shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.</div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> He shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.</div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, with the living bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;</div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v54"><span class="vn">54</span> This is the law for any plague of leprosy, and for an itch,</div>
<div class="v" id="v55"><span class="vn">55</span> and for the destructive mildew of a garment, and for a house,</div>
<div class="v" id="v56"><span class="vn">56</span> and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;</div>
<div class="v" id="v57"><span class="vn">57</span> to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>This is the law of leprosy.</div>
