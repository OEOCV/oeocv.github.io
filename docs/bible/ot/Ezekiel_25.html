<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Tell the children of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says, “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession. They will set their encampments in you and make their dwellings in you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For the Lord Yahweh says: “Because you have clapped your hands, stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the contempt of your soul against the land of Israel,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries. I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,’</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on its frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> to the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I will execute judgments on Moab. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and taken revenge on them,”</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “I will stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and animal from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman. They will fall by the sword even to Dedan.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel. They will do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath. Then they will know my vengeance,” says the Lord Yahweh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because the Philistines have taken revenge, and have taken vengeance with contempt of soul to destroy with perpetual hostility,”</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I lay my vengeance on them.”’”</div>
