<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> They have set up kings, but not by me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They have made princes, and I didn’t approve.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that they may be cut off.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Let Samaria throw out his calf idol!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My anger burns against them!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>How long will it be until they are capable of purity?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For this is even from Israel!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The workman made it, and it is no God;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For they sow the wind,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will reap the whirlwind.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He has no standing grain.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The stalk will yield no head.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For they have gone up to Assyria,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>like a wild donkey wandering alone.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Ephraim has hired lovers for himself.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I wrote for him the many things of my law,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but they were regarded as a strange thing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> As for the sacrifices of my offerings,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they sacrifice meat and eat it,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but Yahweh doesn’t accept them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Now he will remember their iniquity,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and punish their sins.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will return to Egypt.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
