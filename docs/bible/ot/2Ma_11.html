<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now after a very little time, Lysias, the king’s guardian, kinsman, and chancellor, being very displeased about the things that had happened,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> collected about eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and came against the Jews, planing to make the city a home for Greeks,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and to levy tribute on the temple, as <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>on the other sacred places of the nations, and to put up the high priesthood for sale every year.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> He took no account of God’s power, but was puffed up with his ten thousands of infantry, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Coming into Judea and approaching Bethsuron, which was a strong place and about five stadia<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> away from Jerusalem, he pressed it hard.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> When Maccabaeus and his men learned that he was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people with lamentations and tears made supplication to the Lord to send a good angel to save Israel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Maccabaeus himself took up weapons first, and exhorted the others to put themselves in jeopardy together with him and help their kindred; and they went out with him very willingly.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> As they were there, close to Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head in white apparel, brandishing<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> weapons of gold.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> They all together praised the merciful God, and were yet more strengthened in heart, being ready to <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>assail not only men but the wildest animals and walls of iron,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> they advanced in array, having him who is in heaven to fight on their side, for the Lord had mercy on them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Hurling themselves like lions against the enemy, they killed eleven thousand infantry and one thousand six hundred cavalry, and forced all the rest to flee.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Most of them escaped wounded and naked. Lysias himself also escaped by shameful flight.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But as he was a man not void of understanding, pondering the defeat which had befallen him, and considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome because the Almighty God fought on their side, he sent again</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> and persuaded them to come to terms on condition that all their rights were acknowledged, and <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> promised that he would also persuade the king to become their friend.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Maccabaeus gave consent upon all the conditions which Lysias proposed to him, being careful of the common good; for whatever requests Maccabaeus delivered in writing to Lysias concerning the Jews the king allowed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> The letter written to the Jews from Lysias was to this effect:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Lysias to the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup>people of the Jews, greetings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> John and Absalom, who were sent from you, having delivered the document written below, made request concerning the things written therein.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Whatever things therefore needed to be brought before the king I declared to him, and what things were possible he allowed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> If then you will all preserve your good will toward the government, I will also endeavor in the future to contribute to your good.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Concerning this, I have given order in detail, both to these men and to those who are sent from me, to confer with you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Farewell. Written in the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the twenty-fourth day of the month <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup>Dioscorinthius.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> And the king’s letter contained these words:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greetings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Seeing that our father passed to the gods having the wish that the subjects of his kingdom <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup>should be undisturbed and give themselves to the care of their own affairs,</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> we, having heard that the Jews do not consent to our father’s purpose to turn them to the customs of the Greeks, but choose rather their own way of living, and make request that the customs of their law be allowed to them—</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> choosing therefore that this nation also should be free from disturbance, we determine that their temple is to be restored to them, and that they live according to the customs that were in the days of their ancestors.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> You will therefore do well to send messengers to them and give them the right hand of friendship, that they, knowing our mind, may be of good heart, and gladly occupy themselves with the conduct of their own affairs.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> And to the nation, the king’s letter was as follows:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews and to the other Jews, greetings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> If you are all well, it is as we desire. We ourselves also are in good health.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Menelaus informed us that your desire was to return home and follow your own business.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> They therefore who depart home up to the thirtieth day of Xanthicus shall have our <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup>friendship, with full permission</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> that the Jews use their own foods and observe their own laws, even as formerly. None of them shall be in any way molested for the things that have been done in ignorance.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> Moreover I have sent Menelaus also, that he may encourage you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Farewell. Written in the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the fifteenth day of Xanthicus.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> The Romans also sent to them a letter in these words:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Quintus Memmius and Titus Manius, ambassadors of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greetings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> In regard to the things which Lysias the king’s kinsman granted you, we also give consent.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> But as for the things which he judged should be referred to the king, send someone promptly, after you have considered them, that we may publish such decrees as are appropriate for your case; for we are on our way to Antioch.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Therefore send someone with speed, that we also may learn what is your mind.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup>Farewell. Written in the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the fifteenth day of Xanthicus.</div>
