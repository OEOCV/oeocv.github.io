<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> But Judas, who is also called Maccabaeus, and those who were with him, making their way secretly into the villages, called to them their kindred. Taking to them those who had continued in the Jews’ religion, gathered together about six thousand.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> They called upon the Lord to look at the people who were oppressed by all, and to have compassion on the sanctuary that had been profaned by the ungodly men,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> and to have pity on the city that was suffering ruin and ready to be leveled to the ground, and to listen to the blood that cried out to him,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> and to remember the lawless destruction of the innocent infants, and concerning the blasphemies that had been committed against his name, and to show his hatred of wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> When Maccabaeus had trained his men for service, the heathen at once found him irresistible, for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>Coming without warning, he set fire to cities and villages. And in winning back the most important positions, putting to flight no small number of the enemies,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> he especially took advantage of the nights for such assaults. His courage was loudly talked of everywhere.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> But when Philip saw the man gaining ground little by little, and increasing more and more in his success, he wrote to Ptolemy, the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, that he should support the king’s cause.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Ptolemy quickly appointed Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of the king’s <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> chief friends, and sent him, in command of no fewer than twenty thousand of all nations, to destroy the whole race of Judea. With him he joined Gorgias also, a captain and one who had experience in matters of war.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Nicanor resolved by the sale of the captive Jews to make up for the king the tribute of two thousand talents which he was to pay to the Romans.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Immediately he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, inviting them to buy Jewish <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>slaves, promising to deliver seventy <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>slaves for a talent, not expecting the judgment that was to overtake him from the Almighty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> News came to Judas concerning Nicanor’s invasion. When he communicated to those who were with him the presence of the army,</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> those who were cowardly and distrustful of God’s judgment <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup>ran away and left the country.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Others sold all that they had left, and at the same time implored the Lord to deliver those who had been sold as slaves by the impious Nicanor before he ever met them,</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> if not for their own sakes, then for the covenants made with their ancestors, and because he had called them by his holy and glorious name.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> So Maccabaeus gathered his men together, six thousand in number, and exhorted them not to be frightened by the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen who came wrongfully against them, but to fight nobly,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> setting before their eyes the outrage that had been lawlessly perpetrated upon the holy place, and the torture of the city that had been turned to mockery, and further the overthrow of the way of life received from their ancestors.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> “For they,” he said, “trust their weapons and daring deeds, but we trust in the almighty God, since he is able at a nod to cast down those who are coming against us, and even the whole world.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Moreover, he recounted to them the help given from time to time in the days of their ancestors, both in the days of Sennacherib, when one hundred eighty-five thousand perished,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> and in the land of Babylon, in the battle that was fought against the<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Gauls, how they came to the battle with eight thousand in all, with four thousand Macedonians, and how, the Macedonians being hard pressed, the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup>six thousand destroyed the hundred and twenty thousand because of the help which they had from heaven, and took a great deal of plunder.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> And when he had with these words filled them with courage and made them ready to die for the laws and their country, he divided his army into four parts.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> He appointed his brothers, Simon, Joseph, and Jonathan, to be leaders of the divisions with him, giving each the command of one thousand five hundred men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Moreover Eleazer also, having read aloud the sacred book, and having given as watchword, “THE HELP OF GOD”, leading the first band himself, joined battle with Nicanor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Since the Almighty fought on their side, they killed more than nine thousand of the enemy, and wounded and<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> disabled most of Nicanor’s army, and compelled them all to flee.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> They took the money of those who had come there to buy them as slaves. After they had pursued them for some <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup>distance, they returned, being constrained by the time of the day;</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> for it was the day before the Sabbath, and for this reason they made no effort to chase them far.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> When they had gathered <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup>the weapons of the enemy together, and had stripped off their spoils, they kept the Sabbath, greatly blessing and thanking the Lord who had saved them to this day, because he had begun to show mercy to them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> After the Sabbath, when they had given some of the spoils to the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> maimed, and to the widows and orphans, they distributed the rest among themselves and their children.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> When they had accomplished these things and had made a common supplication, they implored the merciful Lord to be wholly reconciled with his servants.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Having had an encounter with the forces of Timotheus and Bacchides, they killed more than twenty thousand of them, and made themselves masters of exceedingly high strongholds, and divided very much plunder, giving the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup>maimed, orphans, widows, and the aged an equal share with themselves.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> When they had gathered the weapons <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup> of the enemy together, they stored them all up carefully in the most strategic positions, and they carried the rest of the spoils to Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> They killed the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm16" href="#fn16">16</a></sup>phylarch of Timotheus’s forces, a most unholy man, and one who had done the Jews much harm.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm17" href="#fn17">17</a></sup> As they celebrated the feast of victory in the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm18" href="#fn18">18</a></sup> city of their fathers, they burned those who had set the sacred <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm19" href="#fn19">19</a></sup>gates on fire, including Callisthenes, who had fled into <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm20" href="#fn20">20</a></sup>a little house. So they received the proper reward for their impiety.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> The thrice-accursed Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants to buy the Jews as slaves,</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> being through the help of the Lord humbled by them who in his eyes were held to be of least account, took off his glorious apparel, and passing through the country, <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm21" href="#fn21">21</a></sup>shunning all company like a fugitive slave, arrived at Antioch, <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm22" href="#fn22">22</a></sup> having, as he thought, had the greatest possible good fortune, though his army was destroyed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> He who had taken upon himself to make tribute sure for the Romans by the captivity of the men of Jerusalem published abroad that the Jews had One who fought for them, and that <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm23" href="#fn23">23</a></sup>because this was so, the Jews were invulnerable, because they followed the laws ordained by him.</div>
