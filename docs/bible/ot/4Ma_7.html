<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The reasoning of our father Eleazar, like a first-rate pilot, steering the vessel of piety in the sea of emotions,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> and flouted by the threats of the tyrant, and overwhelmed with the breakers of torture,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> in no way shifted the rudder of piety until it sailed into the harbor of victory over death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> No beseiged city has ever held out against many and various war machines as that holy man did when his pious soul was tried with the fiery trial of tortures and rackings and moved his besiegers through the religious reasoning that shielded him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For father Eleazar, projecting his disposition, broke the raging waves of the emotions as with a jutting cliff.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> O priest worthy of the priesthood! You didn’t pollute your sacred teeth, nor make your appetite, which had always embraced the clean and lawful, a partaker of profanity.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> O harmonizer with the law, and sage devoted to a divine life!</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Of such a character ought those to be who perform the duties of the law at the risk of their own blood, and defend it with generous sweat by sufferings even to death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> You, father, have gloriously established our right government by your endurance; and making of much account our past service, prevented its destruction, and by your deeds, have made credible the words of philosophy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> O aged man of more power than tortures, elder more vigorous than fire, greatest king over the emotions, Eleazar!</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For as father Aaron, armed with a censer, hastening through the consuming fire, vanquished the flame-bearing angel,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> so, Eleazar, the descendant of Aaron, wasted away by the fire, didn’t give up his reasoning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> What is most wonderful is that though he was an old man, though the labors of his body were now spent, his muscles were relaxed, and his sinews worn out, he recovered youth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> By the spirit of reasoning, and the reasoning of Isaac, he rendered powerless the many-headed rack.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> O blessed old age, and reverend hoar head, and life obedient to the law, which the faithful seal of death perfected.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> If, then, an old man, through religion, despised tortures even to death, then certainly religious reasoning is ruler of the emotions.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> But perhaps some might say, “It is not all who conquer emotions, as not all possess wise reasoning.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But those who have meditated upon religion with their whole heart, these alone can master the emotions of the flesh:</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> they who believe that to God they don’t die; for, as our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, they live to God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> This circumstance, then, is by no means an objection, that some who have weak reasoning are governed by their emotions,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> since what person, walking religiously by the whole rule of philosophy, and believing in God,</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> and knowing that it is a blessed thing to endure all kinds of hardships for virtue, would not, for the sake of religion, master his emotion?</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> For only the wise and brave man is lord over his emotions.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> This is why even boys, trained with the philosophy of religious reasoning, have conquered still more bitter tortures;</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> for when the tyrant was manifestly vanquished in his first attempt, in being unable to force the old man to eat the unclean thing,</div>
