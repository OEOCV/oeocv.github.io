<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The man knew<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Eve his wife. She conceived,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Lamech said to his wives,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for I have slain a man for wounding me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a young man for bruising me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> If Cain will be avenged seven times,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name.</div>
