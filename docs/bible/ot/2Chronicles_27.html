<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However he didn’t enter into Yahweh’s temple. The people still acted corruptly.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> He built the upper gate of Yahweh’s house, and he built much on the wall of Ophel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of silver, ten thousand cors<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The children of Ammon also gave that much to him in the second year, and in the third.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.</div>
