<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,</div>

<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> You shall labor six days, and do all your work,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates;</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
