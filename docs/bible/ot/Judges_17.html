<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears—behold, the silver is with me. I took it.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>His mother said, “May Yahweh bless my son!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, then his mother said, “I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he traveled.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Micah said to him, “Where did you come from?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.” So the Levite went in.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Then Micah said, “Now I know that Yahweh will do good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest.”</div>
