<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>before the evil days come, and the years draw near,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them;”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the clouds return after the rain;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the strong men shall bow themselves,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the grinders cease because they are few,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and those who look out of the windows are darkened,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> and the doors shall be shut in the street;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when the sound of the grinding is low,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> yes, they shall be afraid of heights,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and terrors will be on the way;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the almond tree shall blossom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the grasshopper shall be a burden,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and desire shall fail;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because man goes to his everlasting home,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the mourners go about the streets;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> before the silver cord is severed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or the golden bowl is broken,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or the pitcher is broken at the spring,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or the wheel broken at the cistern,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> and the dust returns to the earth as it was,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the spirit returns to God who gave it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“All is vanity!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.</div>
