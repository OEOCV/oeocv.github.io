<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Is it any wonder? If the lusts of the soul, after participation with what is beautiful, are frustrated,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> on this ground, therefore, the temperate Joseph is praised in that by reasoning, he subdued, on reflection, the indulgence of the senses.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For, although young, and ripe for sexual intercourse, he nullified by reasoning the stimulus of his emotions.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> It isn’t merely the stimulus of sensual indulgence, but that of every desire, that reasoning is able to master.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For instance, the law says, “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Now, then, since it is the law which has forbidden us to desire, I shall much the more easily persuade you, that reasoning is able to govern our lusts, just as it does the affections which are impediments to justice.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Since in what way is a solitary eater, a glutton, and a drunkard reclaimed, unless it is clear that reasoning is lord of the emotions?</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore, a man who regulates his course by the law, even if he is a lover of money, immediately puts pressure on his own disposition by lending to the needy without interest, and cancelling the debt on the seventh year.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> If a man is greedy, he is ruled by the law acting through reasoning, so that he doesn’t glean his harvest crops or vintage. In reference to other points we may perceive that it is reasoning that conquers his emotions.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> For the law conquers even affection toward parents, not surrendering virtue on their account.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> It prevails over love for one’s wife, rebuking her when she breaks the law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> It lords it over the love of parents toward their children, for they punish them for vice. It domineers over the intimacy of friends, reproving them when wicked.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Don’t think it is a strange assertion that reasoning can on behalf of the law conquer even enmity.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> It doesn’t allow cutting down the fruit trees of an enemy, but preserves them from the destroyers, and collects their fallen ruins.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Reason appears to be master of the more violent emotions, like love of empire, empty boasting, and slander.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> For the temperate understanding repels all these malignant emotions, as it does wrath; for it masters even this.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Thus Moses, when angered against Dathan and Abiram, did nothing to them in wrath, but regulated his anger by reasoning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For the temperate mind is able, as I said, to be superior to the emotions, and to correct some and destroy others.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> For why else did our most wise father Jacob blame Simeon and Levi for having irrationally slain the whole race of the Shechemites, saying, “Cursed be their anger!”?</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> For if reasoning didn’t possess the power of subduing angry affections, he would not have said this.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For at the time when God created man, he implanted within him his emotions and moral nature.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> At that time he enthroned the mind above all as the holy leader, through the medium of the senses.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> He gave a law to this mind, by living according to which it will maintain a temperate, just, good, and courageous reign.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> How, then, a man may say, if reasoning is master of the emotions, has it no control over forgetfulness and ignorance?</div>
