<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “‘When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove, for a sin offering.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; then she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“‘This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’”</div>
