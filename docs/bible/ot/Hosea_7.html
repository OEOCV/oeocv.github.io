<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> They don’t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Now their own deeds have engulfed them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are before my face.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> They make the king glad with their wickedness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the princes with their lies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> They are all adulterers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He joined his hand with mockers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For they have prepared their heart like an oven,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>while they lie in wait.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their anger smolders all night.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> They are all hot as an oven,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and devour their judges.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>All their kings have fallen.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There is no one among them who calls to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
