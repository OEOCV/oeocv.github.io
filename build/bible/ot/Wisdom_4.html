<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> It is better to be childless with virtue,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for immortality is in the memory of virtue,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because it is recognized both before God and before men.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> When it is present, people imitate it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They long after it when it has departed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Throughout all time it marches, crowned in triumph,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>victorious in the competition for the prizes that are undefiled.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But the multiplying brood of the ungodly will be of no profit,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their illegitimate offshoots won’t take deep root,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor will they establish a sure hold.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For even if they grow branches and flourish for a season,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>standing unsure, they will be shaken by the wind.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will be uprooted by the violence of winds.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Their branches will be broken off before they come to maturity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their fruit will be useless,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>never ripe to eat, and fit for nothing.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For unlawfully conceived children are witnesses of wickedness<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>against parents when they are investigated.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> But a righteous man, even if he dies before his time, will be at rest.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For honorable old age is not that which stands in length of time,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor is its measure given by number of years,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> but understanding is gray hair to men,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and an unspotted life is ripe old age.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Being found well-pleasing to God, someone was loved.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>While living among sinners he was transported.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> He was caught away, lest evil should change his understanding,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or guile deceive his soul.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For the fascination of wickedness obscures the things which are good,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the whirl of desire perverts an innocent mind.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Being made perfect quickly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he filled a long time;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> for his soul was pleasing to the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore he hurried out of the midst of wickedness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But the peoples saw and didn’t understand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>not considering this, that grace and mercy are with his chosen,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and that he visits his holy ones;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> but a righteous man who is dead will condemn the ungodly who are living,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and youth who is quickly perfected will condemn the many years of an unrighteous man’s old age.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For the ungodly will see a wise man’s end,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and won’t understand what the Lord planned for him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and why he safely kept him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> They will see, and they will despise;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but the Lord will laugh them to scorn.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>After this, they will become a dishonored carcass<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a reproach among the dead forever;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> because he will dash them speechless to the ground,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will shake them from the foundations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will lie utterly waste.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will be in anguish<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and their memory will perish.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> They will come with coward fear when their sins are counted.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their lawless deeds will convict them to their face.</div>
