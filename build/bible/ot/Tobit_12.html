<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> And Tobit called his son Tobias, and said to him, “See, my child, that the man which went with you have his wages, and you must give him more.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> And he said to him, “Father, it is no harm to me to give him the half of those things which I have brought;</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> for he has led me for you in safety, and he cured my wife, and brought my money, and likewise cured you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The old man said, “It is due to him.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> And he called the angel, and said to him, “Take half of all that you have brought.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Then he called them both privately, and said to them, “Bless God, and give him thanks, and magnify him, and give him thanks in the sight of all that live, for the things which he has done with you. It is good to bless God and exalt his name, showing forth with honor the works of God. Don’t be slack to give him thanks.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> It is good to conceal the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God. Do good, and evil won’t find you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Good is prayer with fasting, alms, and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Alms delivers from death, and it purges away all sin. Those who give alms and do righteousness will be filled with life;</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> but those who sin are enemies to their own life.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Surely I will conceal nothing from you. I have said, ‘It is good to conceal the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> And now, when you prayed, and Sarah your daughter-in-law, I brought the memorial of your prayer before the Holy One. When you buried the dead, I was with you likewise.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> And when you didn’t delay to rise up, and leave your dinner, that you might go and cover the dead, your good deed was not hidden from me. I was with you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> And now God sent me to heal you and Sarah your daughter-in-law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels which present the prayers of the saints and go in before the glory of the Holy One.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> And they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces; for they were afraid.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> And he said to them, “Don’t be afraid. You will all have peace; but bless God forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For I came not of any favor of my own, but by the will of your God. Therefore bless him forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> All these days I appeared to you. I didn’t eat or drink, but you all saw a vision.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Now give God thanks, because I ascend to him who sent me. Write in a book all the things which have been done.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Then they rose up, and saw him no more.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> They confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.</div>
