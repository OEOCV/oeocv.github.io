<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> and gave him strength to rule over all things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But when an unrighteous man fell away from her in his anger,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he perished himself in the rage with which he killed his brother.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Moreover, when nations consenting together in wickedness had been confounded,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>wisdom<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> knew the righteous man, and preserved him blameless to God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and kept him strong when his heart yearned toward his child.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> While the ungodly were perishing, wisdom<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> delivered a righteous man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>when he fled from the fire that descended out of heaven on the five cities.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> To whose wickedness a smoking waste still witnesses,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and plants bearing fair fruit that doesn’t ripen,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a disbelieving soul has a memorial: a standing pillar of salt.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For having passed wisdom by,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>not only were they disabled from recognising the things which are good,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but they also left behind them for their life a monument of their folly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to the end that where they stumbled, they might fail even to be unseen;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> but wisdom delivered those who waited on her out of troubles.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> When in their covetousness men dealt harshly with him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>she stood by him and made him rich.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> and in bonds she didn’t depart from him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>until she brought him the sceptre of a kingdom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and authority over those that dealt like a tyrant with him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She also showed those who had mockingly accused him to be false,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and gave him eternal glory.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Wisdom<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> delivered a holy people and a blameless seed from a nation of oppressors.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> She rendered to holy men a reward of their toils.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She guided them along a marvelous way,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and became to them a covering in the day-time,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a starry flame through the night.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> She brought them over the Red sea,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and led them through much water;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
