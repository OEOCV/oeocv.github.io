<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> And Judith began to sing this song of thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the people sang with loud voices this song of praise.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Judith said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“Begin a song to my God with timbrels.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Sing to my Lord with cymbals.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Make melody to him with psalm and praise.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Exalt him, and call upon his name.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For the Lord is the God that crushes battles.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For in his armies in the midst of the people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he delivered me out of the hand of those who persecuted me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Asshur came out of the mountains from the north.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He came with ten thousands of his army.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Its multitude stopped the torrents.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their horsemen covered the hills.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> He said that he would burn up my borders,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>kill my young men with the sword,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>throw my nursing children to the ground,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>give my infants up as prey,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and make my virgins a plunder.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “The Almighty Lord brought them to nothing by the hand of a woman.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For their mighty one didn’t fall by young men,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither did sons of the Titans strike him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Tall giants didn’t attack him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but Judith the daughter of Merari made him weak with the beauty of her countenance.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “For she put off the apparel of her widowhood<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the exaltation of those who were distressed in Israel.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She anointed her face with ointment,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>bound her hair in a tiara,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and took a linen garment to deceive him.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Her sandal ravished his eye.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Her beauty took his soul prisoner.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The sword passed through his neck.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> “The Persians quaked at her daring.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The Medes were daunted at her boldness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “Then my lowly ones shouted aloud.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>My oppressed people were terrified and trembled for fear.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They lifted up their voices and the enemy fled.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> The children of slave-girls pierced them through,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and wounded them as fugitives’ children.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They perished by the army of my Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “I will sing to my God a new song:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>O Lord, you are great and glorious,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>marvelous in strength, invincible.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Let all your creation serve you;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for you spoke, and they were made.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You sent out your spirit, and it built them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There is no one who can resist your voice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> For the mountains will be moved from their foundations with the waters,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the rocks will melt as wax at your presence:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>But you are yet merciful to those who fear you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> For all sacrifice is little for a sweet savor,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all the fat is very little for a whole burnt offering to you;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but he who fears the Lord is great continually.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> “Woe to the nations who rise up against my race!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The Lord Almighty will take vengeance on them in the day of judgment<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and put fire and worms in their flesh;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they will weep and feel their pain forever.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Now when they came to Jerusalem, they worshiped God. When the people were purified, they offered their whole burnt offerings, their free will offerings, and their gifts.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Judith dedicated all Holofernes’ stuff, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken for herself out of his bedchamber, for a gift to the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> And the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for three months, and Judith remained with them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> After these days, everyone departed to his own inheritance. Judith went away to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was honorable in her time in all the land.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Many desired her, but no man knew her all the days of her life from the day that Manasses her husband died and was gathered to his people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> She increased in greatness exceedingly; and she grew old in her husband’s house, to one hundred five years. She let her maid go free. Then she died in Bethulia. They buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> The house of Israel mourned for her seven days. She distributed her goods before she died to all those who were nearest of kin to Manasses her husband, and to those who were nearest of her own kindred.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> There was no one who made the children of Israel afraid any more in the days of Judith, nor for a long time after her death.</div>
