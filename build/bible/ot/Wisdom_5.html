<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Then the righteous man will stand in great boldness<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>before the face of those who afflicted him,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and those who make his labors of no account.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> When they see him, they will be troubled with terrible fear,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will be amazed at the marvel of salvation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> They will speak among themselves repenting,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and for distress of spirit they will groan,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>“This was he whom we used to hold in derision,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>as a parable of reproach.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> We fools considered his life madness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and his end without honor.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> How was he counted among sons of God?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>How is his lot among saints?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Truly we went astray from the way of truth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The light of righteousness didn’t shine for us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The sun didn’t rise for us.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> We<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> took our fill of the paths of lawlessness and destruction.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>We traveled through trackless deserts,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but we didn’t know the Lord’s way.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> What did our arrogance profit us?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>What good have riches and boasting brought us?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Those things all passed away as a shadow,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>like a rumor that runs by,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> like a ship passing through the billowy water,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>which, when it has gone by, there is no trace to be found,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>no pathway of its keel in the waves.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Or it is like when a bird flies through the air,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>no evidence of its passage is found,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but the light wind, lashed with the stroke of its pinions,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and torn apart with the violent rush of the moving wings, is passed through.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Afterwards no sign of its coming remains.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Or it is like when an arrow is shot at a mark,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the air it divided closes up again immediately,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>so that men don’t know where it passed through.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> So we also, as soon as we were born, ceased to be;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and we had no sign of virtue to show,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but we were utterly consumed in our wickedness.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Because the hope of the ungodly man is like chaff carried by the wind,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> as<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> foam vanishing before a tempest;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and is scattered like smoke by the wind,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and passes by as the remembrance of a guest who stays just a day.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But the righteous live forever.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their reward is in the Lord,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the care for them with the Most High.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore they will receive the crown of royal dignity<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and the diadem of beauty from the Lord’s hand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because he will cover them with his right hand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he will shield them with his arm.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> He will take his zeal as complete armor,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will make the whole creation his weapons to punish his enemies:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> He will put on righteousness as a breastplate,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will wear impartial judgment as a helmet.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> He will take holiness as an invincible shield.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> He will sharpen stern wrath for a sword.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The universe will go with him to fight against his frenzied foes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Shafts of lightning will fly with true aim.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>They will leap to the mark from the clouds, as from a well-drawn bow.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Hailstones full of wrath will be hurled as from a catapult.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The water of the sea will be angered against them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Rivers will sternly overwhelm them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> A mighty wind will encounter them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It will winnow them away like a tempest.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>So lawlessness will make all the land desolate.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Their evil-doing will overturn the thrones of princes.</div>
