<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> I loved her and sought her from my youth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I sought to take her for my bride.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I became enamoured by her beauty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> She glorifies her noble birth by living with God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The Sovereign Lord of all loves her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For she is initiated into the knowledge of God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and she chooses his works.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But if riches are a desired possession in life,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>what is richer than wisdom, which makes all things?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> And if understanding is effective,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>who more than<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> wisdom is an architect of the things that exist?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> If a man loves righteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the fruits of wisdom’s labor<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> are virtues,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for she teaches soberness, understanding, righteousness, and courage.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>There is nothing in life more profitable for people than these.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> And if anyone longs for wide experience,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>she knows the things of old, and infers the things to come.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She understands subtleties of speeches and interpretations of dark sayings.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She foresees signs and wonders, and the issues of seasons and times.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore I determined to take her to live with me,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>knowing that she is one who would give me good counsel,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and encourage me in cares and grief.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> Because of her, I will have glory among multitudes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and honor in the sight of elders, though I am young.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I will be found keen when I give judgment.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I will be admired in the presence of rulers.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> When I am silent, they will wait for me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>When I open my lips, they will heed what I say.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>If I continue speaking, they will put their hands on their mouths.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Because of her, I will have immortality,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and leave behind an eternal memory to those who come after me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I will govern peoples.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Nations will be subjected to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Dreaded monarchs will fear me when they hear of me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Among the people, I will show myself to be good, and courageous in war.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> When I come into my house, I will find rest with her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For conversation with her has no bitterness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and living with her has no pain, but gladness and joy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> When I considered these things in myself,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and thought in my heart how immortality is in kinship to wisdom,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> and in her friendship is good delight,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in the labors of her hands is wealth that doesn’t fail,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and understanding is in her companionship,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and great renown in having fellowship with her words,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I went about seeking how to take her to myself.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Now I was a clever child, and received a good soul.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
