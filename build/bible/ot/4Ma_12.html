<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> When he, too, had undergone blessed martyrdom, and died in the cauldron into which he had been thrown, the seventh, the youngest of all, came forward,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> whom the tyrant pitying, though he had been dreadfully reproached by his kindred,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> seeing him already encompassed with chains, had him brought nearer, and endeavored to counsel him, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> “You see the end of the madness of your kindred, for they have died in torture through disobedience. You, if disobedient, having been miserably tormented, will yourself perish prematurely.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But if you obey, you will be my friend, and have a charge over the affairs of the kingdom.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> Having thus exhorted him, he sent for the boy’s mother, that, by showing compassion to her for the loss of so many sons, he might incline her, through the hope of safety, to render the survivor obedient.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> He, after his mother had urged him on in the Hebrew tongue, (as we will soon relate) said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “Release me that I may speak to the king and all his friends.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> They, rejoicing exceedingly at the promise of the youth, quickly let him go.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> He, running up to the pans, said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> “Impious tyrant, and most blasphemous man, were you not ashamed, having received prosperity and a kingdom from God, to kill His servants, and to rack the doers of godliness?</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Therefore the divine vengeance is reserving you for eternal fire and torments, which will cling to you for all time.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Weren’t you ashamed, man as you are, yet most savage, to cut out the tongues of men of like feeling and origin, and having thus abused to torture them?</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But they, bravely dying, fulfilled their religion toward God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But you will groan as you deserve for having slain without cause the champions of virtue.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore,” he continued, “I myself, being about to die,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> will not forsake my kindred.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> I call upon the God of my fathers to be merciful to my race.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> But you, both living and dead, he will punish.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Thus having prayed, he hurled himself into the pans; and so expired.</div>
