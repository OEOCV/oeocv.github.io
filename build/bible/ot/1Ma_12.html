<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Jonathan saw that the time was favorable for him, so he chose men and sent them to Rome to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> He also sent similar letters to the Spartans, and to other places.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> They went to Rome, entered into the senate house, and said, “Jonathan the high priest and the nation of the Jews have sent us to renew for them the friendship and the alliance, as in former time.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> They gave them letters to the men in every place, that they should provide safe conduct for them on their way to the land of Judah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> This is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “Jonathan the high priest, and the senate of the nation, and the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, to their kindred the Spartans, greetings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Even before this time letters were sent to Onias the high priest from Arius,<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> who was reigning among you, to signify that you are our kindred, as the copy written below shows.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Onias welcomed honorably the man who was sent and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of alliance and friendship.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore we also, even though we need none of these things, having for our encouragement the holy books which are in our hands,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> have undertaken to send that we might renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, to the end that we should not become estranged from you altogether; for a long time has passed since you sent your letter to us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and on the other convenient days, remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as it is right and proper to be mindful of kindred.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Moreover, we are glad for your glory.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encompassed us, and the kings who are around us have fought against us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> We were unwilling to be troublesome to you, and to the rest of our allies and friends, in these wars;</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> for we have the help which is from heaven to help us, and we have been delivered from our enemies, and our enemies have been humbled.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> We chose therefore Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them to the Romans, to renew the friendship that we had with them, and the former alliance.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> We commanded them therefore to go also to you, and to salute you, and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of friendship and our brotherhood.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> And now you will do well if you give us a reply.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> And this is the copy of the letters which they sent to Onias:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> “Arius king of the Spartans to Onias the chief priest, greetings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> It has been found in writing, concerning the Spartans and the Jews, that they are kindred, and that they are of the descendants of Abraham.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Now, since this has come to our knowledge, you will do well to write to us of your<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> prosperity.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> We moreover write on our part to you, that your livestock and goods are ours, and ours are yours. We do command therefore that they make report to you accordingly.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> Now Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes had returned to fight against him with a greater army than before,</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> so he marched away from Jerusalem, and met them in the country of Hamath; for he gave them no opportunity to set foot in his country.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> He sent spies into his camp, and they came again, and reported to him that they were preparing to attack them at night.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> But as soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be armed, that all the night long they might be ready for battle. He stationed sentinels around the camp.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> The adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, and they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp then withdrew.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> But Jonathan and his men didn’t know it until the morning; for they saw the fires burning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Jonathan pursued after them, but didn’t overtake them; for they had gone over the river Eleutherus.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Then Jonathan turned toward the Arabians, who are called Zabadaeans, and struck them, and took their spoils.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> He came out from there, and came to Damascus, and took his journey through all the country.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> Simon went out, and took his journey as far as Ascalon, and the strongholds that were near it. Then he turned toward Joppa and took possession of it;</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> for he had heard that they were planning to hand over the stronghold to Demetrius’ men. He set a garrison there to guard it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> Then Jonathan returned and called the elders of the people together. He planned with them to build strongholds in Judea,</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> and to make the walls of Jerusalem higher, and to raise a great mound between the citadel and the city, to separate it from the city, that so it might be isolated, that its garrison might neither buy nor sell.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> They were gathered together to build the city. Part of the wall of the brook that is on the east side fell down, and he repaired the section called Chaphenatha.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> Simon also built Adida in the<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> plain country, made it strong, and set up gates and bars.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> And Tryphon sought to reign over Asia and to crown himself, and to stretch out his hand against Antiochus the king.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> He was afraid that Jonathan wouldn’t allow him, and that he would fight against him; and he sought a way to seize him, that he might destroy him. So he marched out and came to Bethshan.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> Jonathan came out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethshan.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> Tryphon saw that he came with a great army, and he was afraid to stretch out his hand against him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> He received him honorably, and commended him to all his<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his forces to be obedient to him, as to himself.</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> He said to Jonathan, “Why have you put all this people to so much trouble, seeing there is no war between us?</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> Now send them away to their homes, but choose for yourself a few men who shall be with you, and come with me to Ptolemais, and I will give it to you, and the rest of the strongholds and the rest of the forces, and all the king’s officers. Then I will turn around and depart; for this is why I came.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> He put his trust in him, and did even as he said, and sent away his forces, and they departed into the land of Judah.</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> But he reserved to himself three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, but one thousand went with him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, the people of Ptolemais shut the gates and seized him. They killed all those who came in with him with the sword.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> Tryphon sent troops and cavalry into Galilee, and into the Great Plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> They perceived that he had been seized and had perished, along with those who were with him. They encouraged one another and went on their way close together, prepared to fight.</div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> Those who followed them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives, and turned back again.</div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> They all came in peace into the land of Judah, and they mourned for Jonathan and those who were with him, and they were very afraid. All Israel mourned with a great mourning.</div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> And all the Gentiles who were around them sought to destroy them utterly; for they said, “They have no ruler nor anyone to help them. Now therefore let’s fight against them, and take away their memory from among men.”</div>
