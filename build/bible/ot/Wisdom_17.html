<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> For your judgments are great, and hard to interpret;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>therefore undisciplined souls went astray.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> For when lawless men had supposed that they held a holy nation in their power,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they, prisoners of darkness, and bound in the fetters of a long night,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>kept close beneath their roofs,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>lay exiled from the eternal providence.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For while they thought that they were unseen in their secret sins,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they were divided from one another by a dark curtain of forgetfulness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>stricken with terrible awe, and very troubled by apparitions.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For neither did the dark recesses that held them guard them from fears,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but terrifying sounds rang around them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and dismal phantoms appeared with unsmiling faces.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> And no power of fire prevailed to give light,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither were the brightest flames of the stars strong enough to illuminate that gloomy night;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> but only the glimmering of a self-kindled fire appeared to them, full of fear.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>In terror, they considered the things which they saw<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to be worse than that sight, on which they could not gaze.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> The mockeries of their magic arts were powerless, now,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a shameful rebuke of their boasted understanding:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> For those who promised to drive away terrors and disorders from a sick soul,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>these were sick with a ludicrous fearfulness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For even if no troubling thing frighted them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>yet, scared with the creeping of vermin and hissing of serpents,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> they perished trembling in fear,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>refusing even to look at the air, which could not be escaped on any side.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For wickedness, condemned by a witness within, is a coward thing,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and, being pressed hard by conscience, always has added forecasts of the worst.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For fear is nothing else but a surrender of the help which reason offers;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> and from within, the expectation of being less<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>prefers ignorance of the cause that brings the torment.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But they, all through the night which was powerless indeed,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and which came upon them out of the recesses of powerless Hades,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>sleeping the same sleep,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> now were haunted by monstrous apparitions,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and now were paralyzed by their soulâ€™s surrendering;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for sudden and unexpected fear came upon them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> So then whoever it might be, sinking down in his place,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>was kept captive, shut up in that prison which was not barred with iron;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> for whether he was a farmer, or a shepherd,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or a laborer whose toils were in the wilderness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he was overtaken, and endured that inescapable sentence;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Whether there was a whistling wind,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or a melodious sound of birds among the spreading branches,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or a measured fall of water running violently,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> or a harsh crashing of rocks hurled down,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or the swift course of animals bounding along unseen,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or the voice of wild beasts harshly roaring,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or an echo rebounding from the hollows of the mountains,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>all these things paralyzed them with terror.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> For the whole world was illuminated with clear light,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and was occupied with unhindered works,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> while over them alone was spread a heavy night,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>an image of the darkness that should afterward receive them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but to themselves, they were heavier than darkness.</div>
