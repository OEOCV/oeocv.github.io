<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> Now when I had come home again, and my wife Anna was restored to me, and my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared for me, and I sat down to eat.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> I saw abundance of meat, and I said to my son, “Go and bring whatever poor man you find of our kindred, who is mindful of the Lord. Behold, I wait for you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Then he came, and said, “Father, one of our race is strangled, and has been cast out in the marketplace.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> Before I had tasted anything, I sprang up, and took him up into a chamber until the sun had set.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Then I returned, washed myself, ate my bread in heaviness,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> and remembered the prophecy of Amos, as he said,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>“Your feasts will be turned into mourning,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and all your mirth into lamentation.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> So I wept: and when the sun had set, I went and dug a grave, and buried him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> My neighbors mocked me, and said, “He is no longer afraid to be put to death for this matter; and yet he fled away. Behold, he buries the dead again.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> The same night I returned from burying him, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted; and my face was uncovered.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I didn’t know that there were sparrows in the wall. My eyes were open and the sparrows dropped warm dung into my eyes, and white films came over my eyes. I went to the physicians, and they didn’t help me; but Achiacharus nourished me, until I went<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> into Elymais.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> My wife Anna wove cloth in the women’s chambers,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> and sent the work back to the owners. They on their part paid her wages, and also gave her a kid.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> But when it came to my house, it began to cry, and I said to her, “Where did this kid come from? Is it stolen? Give it back to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat anything that is stolen.”</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But she said, “It has been given to me for a gift more than the wages.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I didn’t believe her, and I asked her to return it to the owners; and I was ashamed of her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>But she answered and said to me, “Where are your alms and your righteous deeds? Behold, you and all your works are known.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>”</div>
