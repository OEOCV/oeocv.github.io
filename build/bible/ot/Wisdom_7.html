<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> I myself am also<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> mortal, like everyone else,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and am a descendant of one formed first and born of the earth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> I molded into flesh in the time of ten months in my mother’s womb,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>being compacted in blood from the seed of man and pleasure of marriage.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I also, when I was born, drew in the common air,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and fell upon the kindred earth,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>uttering, like all, for my first voice, the same cry.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I was nursed with care in swaddling clothes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For no king had a different beginning,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> but all men have one entrance into life, and a common departure.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For this cause I prayed, and understanding was given to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I asked, and a spirit of wisdom came to me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> I preferred her before sceptres and thrones.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I considered riches nothing in comparison to her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Neither did I liken to her any priceless gem,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because all gold in her presence is a little sand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and silver will be considered as clay before her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I loved her more than health and beauty,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and I chose to have her rather than light,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because her bright shining is never laid to sleep.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> All good things came to me with her,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and innumerable riches are in her hands.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> And I rejoiced over them all because wisdom leads them;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>although I didn’t know that she was their mother.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> As I learned without guile, I impart without grudging.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>I don’t hide her riches.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> For she is a treasure for men that doesn’t fail,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and those who use it obtain friendship with God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>commended by the gifts which they present through discipline.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But may God grant that I may speak his judgment,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and to conceive thoughts worthy of what has been given me;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because he is one who guides even wisdom and who corrects the wise.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> For both we and our words are in his hand,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>with all understanding and skill in various crafts.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For he himself gave me an unerring knowledge of the things that are,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to know the structure of the universe and the operation of the elements;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> the beginning, end, and middle of times;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the alternations of the solstices and the changes of seasons;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> the circuits of years and the positions of stars;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> the natures of living creatures and the raging of wild beasts;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the violence of<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> winds and the thoughts of men;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> All things that are either secret or manifest I learned,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> for wisdom, that is the architect of all things, taught me.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span>For there is in her a spirit that is quick to understand, holy,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>unique, manifold, subtle, freely moving, clear in utterance, unpolluted,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>distinct, invulnerable, loving what is good, keen, unhindered,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> beneficent, loving toward man, steadfast, sure, free from care, all-powerful, all-surveying,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and penetrating through all spirits that are quick to understand, pure, most subtle.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> For wisdom is more mobile than any motion.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Yes, she pervades and penetrates all things by reason of her purity.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> For she is a breath of the power of God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore nothing defiled can find entrance into her.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> For she is a reflection of everlasting light,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>an unspotted mirror of the working of God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and an image of his goodness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Although she is one, she has power to do all things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Remaining in herself, she renews all things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>From generation to generation passing into holy souls,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>she makes friends of God and prophets.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> For God loves nothing as much as one who dwells with wisdom.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> For she is fairer than the sun,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and above all the constellations of the stars.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>She is better than light.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> For daylight yields to night,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but evil does not prevail against wisdom.</div>
