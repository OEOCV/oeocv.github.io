<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> For your incorruptible spirit is in all things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Therefore you convict little by little those who fall from the right way,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and, putting them in remembrance by the things wherein they sin, you admonish them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that escaping from their wickedness they may believe in you, O Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For truly the old inhabitants of your holy land,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> hating them because they practiced detestable works of enchantments and unholy rites—<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> merciless slaughters of children<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and sacrificial banquets of men’s flesh and of blood—<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> allies in an impious fellowship,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and murderers of their own helpless babes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>it was your counsel to destroy by the hands of our fathers;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> that the land which in your sight is most precious of all<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>might receive a worthy colony of God’s servants.<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Nevertheless you even spared these as men,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you sent hornets<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> as forerunners of your army,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to cause them to perish little by little.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Not that you were unable to subdue the ungodly under the hand of the righteous in battle,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or by terrible beasts or by a stern word to make away with them at once,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> but judging them little by little you gave them a chance to repent,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>not being ignorant that their nature by birth was evil,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>their wickedness inborn,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and that their manner of thought would never be changed.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For they were a cursed seed from the beginning.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>It wasn’t through fear of any that you left them unpunished for their sins.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For who will say, “What have you done?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or “Who will withstand your judgment?”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Who will accuse you for the perishing of nations which you caused?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Or who will come and stand before you as an avenger for unrighteous men?<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For there isn’t any God beside you that cares for all,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that you might show that you didn’t judge unrighteously.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> No king or prince will be able to confront you<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>about those whom you have punished.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But being righteous, you rule all things righteously,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>deeming it a thing alien from your power<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to condemn one who doesn’t deserve to be punished.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> For your strength is the source of righteousness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and your sovereignty over all makes you to forbear all.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For when men don’t believe that you are perfect in power, you show your strength,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in dealing with those who think this, you confuse their boldness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But you, being sovereign in strength, judge in gentleness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and with great forbearance you govern us;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the power is yours whenever you desire it.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> But you taught your people by such works as these,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>how the righteous must be kind.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>You made your sons to have good hope,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because you give repentance when men have sinned.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> For if on those who were enemies of your servants<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> and deserving of death,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you took vengeance with so great deliberation and indulgence,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>giving them times and opportunities when they might escape from their wickedness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> with how great care you judged your sons,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to whose fathers you gave oaths and covenants of good promises!<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Therefore while you chasten us, you scourge our enemies ten thousand times more,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to the intent that we may ponder your goodness when we judge,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and when we are judged may look for mercy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Therefore also the unrighteous that lived in a life of folly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>you tormented through their own abominations.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> For truly they went astray very far in the ways of error,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Taking as gods those animals<sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> which even among their enemies were held in dishonor,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>deceived like foolish babes.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore, as to unreasoning children, you sent your judgment to mock them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> But those who would not be admonished by mild correction<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>will experience the deserved judgment of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> For through the sufferings they were indignant of,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>being punished in these creatures which they supposed to be gods,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they saw and recognized as the true God him whom they previously refused to know.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Therefore also the result of extreme condemnation came upon them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
