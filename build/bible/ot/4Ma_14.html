<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> More that this, they even urged them on to this mistreatment; so that they not only despised pains themselves, but they even got the better of their affections of brotherly love.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Reasoning is more royal than a king, and freer than freemen!</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> What a sacred and harmonious concert of the seven kindred as concerning piety!</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> None of the seven youths turned cowardly or shrank back from death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> But all of them, as though running the road to immortality, hastened on to death through tortures.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For just as hands and feet are moved sympathetically with the directions of the soul, so those holy youths agreed to death for religion’s sake, as through the immortal soul of religion.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> O holy seven of harmonious kindred! For as the seven days of creation, about religion,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> so the youths, circling around the number seven, annulled the fear of torments.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> We now shudder at the recital of the affliction of those young men; but they not only saw, and not only heard the immediate execution of the threat, but undergoing it, persevered; and that through the pains of fire.</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> What could be more painful? For the power of fire, being sharp and quick, speedily dissolved their bodies.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> Don’t think it wonderful that reasoning ruled over those men in their torments, when even a woman’s mind despised more manifold pains.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For the mother of those seven youths endured the rackings of each of her children.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> Consider how comprehensive is the love of offspring, which draws every one to sympathy of affection,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> where irrational animals possess a similar sympathy and love for their offspring with men.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> The tame birds frequenting the roofs of our houses defend their fledglings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Others build their nests, and hatch their young, on the tops of mountains and in the precipices of valleys, and the holes and tops of trees, and keep away the intruder.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> If not able to do this, they fly circling round them in agony of affection, calling out in their own note, and save their offspring in whatever manner they are able.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> But why should we point attention to the sympathy toward children shown by irrational animals?</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Even bees, at the season of honey-making, attack all who approach, and pierce with their sting, as with a sword, those who draw near their hive, and repel them even to death.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> But sympathy with her children didn’t turn away the mother of the young men, who had a spirit kindred with that of Abraham.</div>
