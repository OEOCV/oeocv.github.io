<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> “Come therefore and let’s enjoy the good things that exist.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let’s use the creation earnestly as in our youth.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Let’s fill ourselves with costly wine and perfumes,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and let no spring flower pass us by.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Let’s crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> But let’s lie in wait for the righteous man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because he annoys us,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>is contrary to our works,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>reproaches us with sins against the law,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and charges us with sins against our training.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> We were regarded by him as something worthless,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and he abstains from our ways as from uncleanness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He calls the latter end of the righteous happy.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>He boasts that God is his father.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Let’s see if his words are true.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Let’s test what will happen at the end of his life.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Let’s test him with insult and torture,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that we may find out how gentle he is,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and test his patience.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Let’s condemn him to a shameful death,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for he will be protected, according to his words.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>

<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> and they didn’t know the mysteries of God,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>neither did they hope for wages of holiness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>nor did they discern that there is a prize for blameless souls.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> Because God created man for incorruption,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and made him an image of his own everlastingness;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
