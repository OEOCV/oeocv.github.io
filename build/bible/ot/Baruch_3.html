<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, the soul in anguish and the troubled spirit cries to you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; for you are a merciful God. Yes, have mercy upon us, because we have sinned before you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> For you are enthroned forever, and we keep perishing.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, hear now the prayer of the dead Israelites, and of the children of those who were sinners before you, who didn’t listen to the voice of you their God; because of this, these plagues cling to us.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Don’t remember the iniquities of our fathers, but remember your power and your name at this time.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> For you are the Lord our God, and we will praise you, O Lord.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For this cause, you have put your fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon your name. We will praise you in our captivity, for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our fathers who sinned before you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity where you have scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to penalty according to all the iniquities of our fathers who departed from the Lord our God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life! Give ear to understand wisdom!</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> How is it, O Israel, that you are in your enemies’ land, that you have become old in a strange country, that you are defiled with the dead,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> that you are counted with those who are in Hades?</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> If you had walked in the way of God, you would have dwelled in peace forever.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> Learn where there is wisdom, where there is strength, and where there is understanding, that you may also know where there is length of days and life, where there is the light of the eyes and peace.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Who has found out her place? Who has come into her treasuries?</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> Where are the princes of the heathen, and those who ruled the beasts that are on the earth,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> those who had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and those who hoarded up silver and gold, in which people trust, and of their getting there is no end?</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For those who diligently sought silver, and were so anxious, and whose works are past finding out,</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> they have vanished and gone down to Hades, and others have come up in their place.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Younger men have seen the light and lived upon the earth, but they haven’t known the way of knowledge,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> nor understood its paths. Their children haven’t embraced it. They are far off from their way.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> It has not been heard of in Canaan, neither has it been seen in Teman.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> The sons also of Agar who seek understanding, which are in the land, the merchants of Merran and Teman, and the authors of fables, and the searchers out of understanding—none of these have known the way of wisdom or remembered her paths.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> O Israel, how great is the house of God! How large is the place of his possession!</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> It is great and has no end. It is high and unmeasurable.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Giants were born that were famous of old, great of stature, and expert in war.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> God didn’t choose these, nor did he give the way of knowledge to them,</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> so they perished, because they had no wisdom. They perished through their own foolishness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Who has gone up into heaven, taken her, and brought her down from the clouds?</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Who has gone over the sea, found her, and will bring her for choice gold?</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> There is no one who knows her way, nor any who comprehend her path.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> But he that knows all things knows her, he found her out with his understanding. He who prepared the earth for all time has filled it with four-footed beasts.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> It is he who sends forth the light, and it goes. He called it, and it obeyed him with fear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> The stars shone in their watches, and were glad. When he called them, they said, “Here we are.” They shone with gladness to him who made them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> This is our God. No other can be compared to him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> He has found out all the way of knowledge, and has given it to Jacob his servant and to Israel who is loved by him.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Afterward she appeared upon earth, and lived with men.</div>
