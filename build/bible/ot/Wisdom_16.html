<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> For this cause, they were deservedly punished through creatures like those which they worship,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and tormented through a multitude of vermin.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Instead of this punishment, you, giving benefits to your people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>prepared quails for food,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>a delicacy to satisfy the desire of their appetite,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> to the end that your enemies, desiring food,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>might for the hideousness of the creatures sent among them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>loathe even the necessary appetite;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but these, your people, having for a short time suffered lack,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>might even partake of delicacies.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> For it was necessary that inescapable lack should come upon those oppressors,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but that to these it should only be showed how their enemies were tormented.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For even when terrible raging of wild beasts came upon your people,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and they were perishing by the bites of crooked serpents,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>your wrath didn’t continue to the uttermost;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> but for admonition were they troubled for a short time,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>having a token of salvation<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>to put them in remembrance of the commandment of your law;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> for he who turned toward it was not saved because of that which was seen,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but because of you, the Savior of all.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Yes, and in this you persuaded our enemies<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that you are he who delivers out of every evil.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> For the bites of locusts and flies truly killed them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>No healing for their life was found,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>because they were worthy to be punished by such things.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> But your children weren’t overcome by the very fangs of venomous dragons,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for your mercy passed by where they were and healed them.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> For they were bitten to put them in remembrance of your oracles,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and were quickly saved, lest, falling into deep forgetfulness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>they should become unable to respond to your kindness.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> For truly it was neither herb nor poultice that cured them,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but your word, O Lord, which heals all people.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> For you have authority over life and death,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you lead down to the gates of Hades, and lead up again.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> But though a man kills by his wickedness,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>he can’t retrieve the spirit that has departed<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>or release the imprisoned soul.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span><span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> But it is not possible to escape your hand;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> for ungodly men, refusing to know you, were scourged in the strength of your arm,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>pursued with strange rains and hails and relentless storms,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and utterly consumed with fire.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> For, what was most marvelous,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>in the water which quenches all things, the fire burned hotter;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>for the world fights for the righteous.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> For at one time the flame was restrained,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that it might not burn up the creatures sent against the ungodly,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but that these themselves as they looked might see that they were chased by the judgment of God.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> At another time even in the midst of water it burns more intensely than fire,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that it may destroy the produce of an unrighteous land.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> Instead of these things, you gave your people angels’ food to eat,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and you provided ready-to-eat bread for them from heaven without toil,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>having the virtue of every pleasant flavor,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and agreeable to every taste.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For your nature showed your sweetness toward your children,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>while that bread, serving the desire of the eater,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>changed itself according to every man’s choice.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> But snow and ice endured fire, and didn’t melt,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that people might know that fire was destroying the fruits of the enemies,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>burning in the hail and flashing in the rains;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> and that this fire, again, in order that righteous people may be nourished,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>has even forgotten its own power.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> For the creation, ministering to you, its maker,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>strains its force against the unrighteous for punishment<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and in kindness, slackens it on behalf of those who trust in you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore at that time also, converting itself into all forms,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>it ministered to your all-nourishing bounty,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>according to the desire of those who had need,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> that your children, whom you loved, O Lord, might learn<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>that it is not the growth of crops that nourishes a man,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>but that your word preserves those who trust you.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> For that which was not destroyed by fire,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>melted away when it was simply warmed by a faint sunbeam,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> that it might be known that we must rise before the sun to give you thanks,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and must pray to you at the dawning of the light;<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> for the hope of the unthankful will melt as the winter’s hoar frost,<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>and will flow away as water that has no use.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
