<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> He answered me, “The Most High has made this world for many, but the world to come for few.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> Now I will tell you a parable, Esdras. Just as when you ask the earth, it will say to you that it gives very much clay from which earthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold comes from. Even so is the course of the present world.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> Many have been created, but few will be saved.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> I answered, “Drink your fill of understanding then, O my soul, and let my heart devour wisdom.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> For you <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>have come here apart from your will, and depart against your will, for you have only been given a short time to live.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> O Lord over us, grant to your servant that we may pray before you, and give us seed for our heart and cultivation for our understanding, that fruit may grow from it, by which everyone who is corrupt, who bears the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>likeness of a man, may live.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> For you alone exist, and we all one workmanship of your hands, just as you have said.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Because you give life to the body that is now fashioned in the womb, and give it members, your creature is preserved in fire and water, and your workmanship endures nine months as your creation which is created in it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> But that which keeps and that which is kept will both be kept <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>by your keeping. When the womb gives up again what has grown in it,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> you have commanded that out of the parts of the body, that is to say, out of the breasts, be given milk, which is the fruit of the breasts,</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> that the body that is fashioned may be nourished for a time, and afterwards you guide it in your mercy.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Yes, you have brought it up in your righteousness, nurtured it in your law, and corrected it with your judgment.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> You put it to death as your creation, and make it live as your work.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> If therefore you <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>lightly and suddenly destroy him which with so great labor was fashioned by your commandment, to what purpose was he made?</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Now therefore I will speak. About man in general, you know best, but about your people for whose sake I am sorry,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> and for your inheritance, for whose cause I mourn, for Israel, for whom I am heavy, and for the seed of Jacob, for whose sake I am troubled,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> therefore I will begin to pray before you for myself and for them; for I see the failings of us who dwell in the land;</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> but I have heard the swiftness of the judgment which is to come.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Therefore hear my voice, and understand my saying, and I will speak before you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>The beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was taken up. He said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> “O Lord, you who remain forever, whose eyes are exalted, and whose chambers are in the air,</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> whose throne is beyond measure, whose glory is beyond comprehension, before whom the army of angels stand with trembling,</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> at whose bidding they are changed to wind and fire, whose word is sure, and sayings constant, whose ordinance is strong, and commandment fearful,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> whose look dries up the depths, and whose indignation makes the mountains to melt away, and whose truth bears witness—</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> hear, O Lord, the prayer of your servant, and give ear to the petition of your handiwork.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Attend to my words, for as long as I live, I will speak, and as long as I have understanding, I will answer.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Don’t look at the sins of your people, but on those who have served you in truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> Don’t regard the doings of those who act wickedly, but of those who have kept your covenants in affliction.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> Don’t think about those who have lived wickedly before you, but remember those who have willingly known your fear.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> Let it not be your will to destroy those who have lived like cattle, but look at those who have <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup>clearly taught your law.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> Don’t be indignant at those who are deemed worse than animals, but love those who have always put their trust in your glory.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> For we and our fathers have <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup>passed our lives in <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup>ways that bring death, but you are called merciful because of us sinners.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> For if you have a desire to have mercy upon us who have no works of righteousness, then you will be called merciful.</div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> For the just, which have many good works laid up with you, will be rewarded for their own deeds.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> For what is man, that you should take displeasure at him? Or what is a corruptible race, that you should be so bitter toward it?</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> For in truth, there is no man among those who are born who has not done wickedly, and among those who have lived, there is none which have not done wrong.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> For in this, O Lord, your righteousness and your goodness will be declared, if you are merciful to those who have no store of good works.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> Then answered he me, “Some things you have spoken rightly, and it will happen according to your words.</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> For indeed I will not think about the fashioning of those who have sinned, or about their death, their judgment, or their destruction;</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> but I will rejoice over the creation of the righteous and their pilgrimage, their salvation, and the reward that they will have.</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> Therefore as I have spoken, so it will be.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> For as the farmer sows many seeds in the ground, and plants many trees, and yet not all that is sown will <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup>come up in due season, neither will all that is planted take root, even so those who are sown in the world will not all be saved.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> Then I answered, “If I have found favor, let me speak before you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> If the farmer’s seed doesn’t come up because it hasn’t received your rain in due season, or if it is ruined by too much rain and perishes,</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> likewise man, who is formed with your hands and is called your own image, because he is made like you, for whose sake you have formed all things, even him have you made like the farmer’s seed.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> Don’t be angry with us, but spare your people and have mercy upon your inheritance, for you have mercy upon your own creation.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> Then he answered me, “Things present are for those who live now, and things to come for those who will live hereafter.</div>
<div class="v" id="v47"><span class="vn">47</span> For you come far short of being able to love my creature more than I. But you have compared yourself to the unrighteous. Don’t do that!</div>
<div class="v" id="v48"><span class="vn">48</span> Yet in this will you be admirable to the Most High,</div>
<div class="v" id="v49"><span class="vn">49</span> in that you have humbled yourself, as it becomes you, and have not judged yourself among the righteous, so as to be much glorified.</div>
<div class="v" id="v50"><span class="vn">50</span> For many grievous miseries will fall on those who dwell in the world in the last times, because they have walked in great pride.</div>
<div class="v" id="v51"><span class="vn">51</span> But understand for yourself, and for those who inquire concerning the glory of those like you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v52"><span class="vn">52</span> because paradise is opened to you. The tree of life is planted. The time to come is prepared. Plenteousness is made ready. A city is built. Rest is <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup>allowed. Goodness is perfected, and wisdom is perfected beforehand.</div>
<div class="v" id="v53"><span class="vn">53</span> The root of evil is sealed up from you. Weakness is done away from you, and <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup>death is hidden. Hell and corruption have fled into forgetfulness.</div>
<div class="v" id="v54"><span class="vn">54</span> Sorrows have passed away, and in the end, the treasure of immortality is shown.</div>
<div class="v" id="v55"><span class="vn">55</span> Therefore ask no more questions concerning the multitude of those who perish.</div>
<div class="v" id="v56"><span class="vn">56</span> For when they had received liberty, they despised the Most High, scorned his law, and forsook his ways.</div>
<div class="v" id="v57"><span class="vn">57</span> Moreover they have trodden down his righteous,</div>
<div class="v" id="v58"><span class="vn">58</span> and said in their heart that there is no God—even knowing that they must die.</div>
<div class="v" id="v59"><span class="vn">59</span> For as the things I have said will welcome you, so thirst and pain which are prepared for them. For the Most High didn’t intend that men should be destroyed,</div>
<div class="v" id="v60"><span class="vn">60</span> but those who are created have themselves defiled the name of him who made them, and were unthankful to him who prepared life for them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v61"><span class="vn">61</span> Therefore my judgment is now at hand,</div>
<div class="v" id="v62"><span class="vn">62</span> which I have not shown to all men, but to you, and a few like you.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span>Then I answered,</div>
<div class="v" id="v63"><span class="vn">63</span> “Behold, O Lord, now have you shown me the multitude of the wonders which you will do in the last times, but you haven’t shown me when.”</div>
