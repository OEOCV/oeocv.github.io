<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> When he had died, disfigured in his torments, the fifth leaped forward, and said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> “I don’t intend, O tyrant, to get excused from the torment which is on behalf of virtue.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> But I have come of my own accord, that by my death you may owe heavenly vengeance and punishment for more crimes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> O you hater of virtue and of men, what have we done that you thus revel in our blood?</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Does it seem evil to you that we worship the Founder of all things, and live according to his surpassing law?</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> But this is worthy of honors, not torments,</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> if you had been capable of the higher feelings of men, and possessed the hope of salvation from God.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> Behold now, being alien from God, you make war against those who are religious toward God.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> As he said this, the spearbearers bound him and drew him to the rack,</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> to which binding him at his knees, and fastening them with iron fetters, they bent down his loins upon the wedge of the wheel; and his body was then dismembered, scorpion-fashion.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> With his breath thus confined, and his body strangled, he said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> “A great favor you bestow upon us, O tyrant, by enabling us to manifest our adherence to the law by means of nobler sufferings.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> He also being dead, the sixth, quite a youth, was brought out. On the tyrant asking him whether he would eat and be delivered, he said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> “I am indeed younger than my brothers, but in understanding I am as old;</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> for having been born and reared to the same end. We are bound to die also on behalf of the same cause.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> So that if you think it is proper to torment us for not eating the unclean, then torment!”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> As he said this, they brought him to the wheel.</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Extended upon this, with limbs racked and dislocated, he was gradually roasted from beneath.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> Having heated sharp spits, they approached them to his back; and having transfixed his sides, they burned away his entrails.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> He, while tormented, said, “O good and holy contest, in which for the sake of religion, we kindred have been called to the arena of pain, and have not been conquered.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> For religious understanding, O tyrant, is unconquered.</div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> Armed with upright virtue, I also will depart with my kindred.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> I, too, bearing with me a great avenger, O inventor of tortures, and enemy of the truly pious.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> We six youths have destroyed your tyranny.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> For isn’t your inability to overrule our reasoning, and to compel us to eat the unclean, your destruction?</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Your fire is cold to us. Your racks are painless, and your violence harmless.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> For the guards not of a tyrant but of a divine law are our defenders. Through this we keep our reasoning unconquered.”</div>
