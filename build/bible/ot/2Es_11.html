<div class="biblehtmlcontent verses" id="verses">
<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> It came to pass the second night that I saw a dream, and behold, an eagle which had twelve feathered wings and three heads came up from the sea.</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> I saw, and behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of heaven blew on her, <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>and the clouds were gathered together against her.</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> I saw, and out of her wings there grew other wings near them; and they became little, tiny wings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> But her heads were at rest. The head in the middle was larger than the other heads, yet rested it with them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> Moreover I saw, and behold, the eagle flew with her wings to reign over the earth and over those who dwell therein.</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> I saw how all things under heaven were subject to her, and no one spoke against her—no, not one creature on earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> I saw, and behold, the eagle rose on her talons, and uttered her voice to her wings, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> “Don’t all watch at the same time. Let each one sleep in his own place and watch in turn;</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> but let the heads be preserved for the last.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I saw, and behold, the voice didn’t come out of her heads, but from the midst of her body.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I counted <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>her wings that were near the others, and behold, there were eight of them.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> I saw, and behold, on the right side one wing arose and reigned over all the earth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> When it reigned, the end of it came, and it disappeared, so that its place appeared no more. The next wing rose up and reigned, and it ruled a long time.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> It happened that when it reigned, its end came also, so that it disappeared, like the first.</div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> Behold, a voice came to it, and said,</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> “Listen, you who have ruled over the earth all this time! I this proclaim to you, before you disappear,</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> none after you will rule as long as you, not even half as long.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> Then the third arose, and ruled as the others before, and it also disappeared.</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> So it went with all the wings one after another, as every one ruled, and then disappeared.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> I saw, and behold, in process of time the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>wings that followed were set up on the <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>right side, that they might rule also. Some of them ruled, but in a while they disappeared.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> Some of them also were set up, but didn’t rule.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> After this I saw, and behold, the twelve wings disappeared, along with two of the little wings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> There was no more left on the eagle’s body, except the three heads that rested, and six little wings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> I saw, and behold, two little wings divided themselves from the six and remained under the head that was on the right side; but four remained in their place.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> I saw, and behold, these <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup>under wings planned to set up themselves and to rule.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> I saw, and behold, there was one set up, but in a while it disappeared.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> A second also did so, and it disappeared faster than the first.</div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> I saw, and behold, the two that remained also planned between themselves to reign.</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> While they thought about it, behold, one of the heads that were at rest awakened, the one that was in the middle, for that was greater than the two other heads.</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> I saw how it joined the two other heads with it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> Behold, the head turned with those who were with it, and ate the two <sup class="fnm"><a name="fnm6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup>under wings that planned to reign.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> But this head held the whole earth in possession, and ruled over those who dwell in it with much oppression. It had stronger governance over the world than all the wings that had gone before.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> After this I saw, and behold, the head also that was in the middle suddenly disappeared, like the wings.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> But the two heads remained, which also reigned the same way over the earth and over those who dwell in it.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> I saw, and behold, the head on the right side devoured the one that was on the left side.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> Then I heard a voice, which said to me, “Look in front of you, and consider the thing that you see.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> I saw, and behold, something like a lion roused out of the woods roaring. I heard how he sent out a man’s voice to the eagle, and spoke, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> “Listen and I will talk with you. The Most High will say to you,</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> ‘Aren’t you the one that remains of the four animals whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of my times might come through them?</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> The fourth came and overcame all the animals that were past, and ruled the world with great trembling, and the whole extent of the earth with grievous oppression. He lived on the earth such a long time with deceit.</div>
<div class="v" id="v41"><span class="vn">41</span> You have judged the earth, but not with truth.</div>
<div class="v" id="v42"><span class="vn">42</span> For you have afflicted the meek, you have hurt the peaceful, you have hated those who speak truth, you have loved liars, destroyed the dwellings of those who produced fruit, and threw down the walls of those who did you no harm.</div>
<div class="v" id="v43"><span class="vn">43</span> Your insolence has come up to the Most High, and your pride to the Mighty.</div>
<div class="v" id="v44"><span class="vn">44</span> The Most High also has looked at his times, and behold, they are ended, and his ages are fulfilled.</div>
<div class="v" id="v45"><span class="vn">45</span> Therefore appear no more, you eagle, nor your horrible wings, nor your evil little wings, nor your cruel heads, nor your hurtful talons, nor all your worthless body,</div>
<div class="v" id="v46"><span class="vn">46</span> that all the earth may be refreshed and relieved, being delivered from your violence, and that she may hope for the judgment and mercy of him who made her.’”</div>
