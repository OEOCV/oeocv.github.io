<h2>THE SECOND BOOK OF ESDRAS</h2><span class="css" style="font-style: italic; -bmc-usfm-tag: bk;">The Second Book of Esdras</span> is included in the Slavonic Bible as <span class="css" style="font-style: italic; -bmc-usfm-tag: bk;">3 Esdras</span>, but is not found in the Greek Septuagint. It is included in the Appendix to the Latin Vulgate Bible as <span class="css" style="font-style: italic; -bmc-usfm-tag: bk;">4 Esdras</span>. It is considered to be Apocrypha by most church traditions. It is preserved here for its supplementary historical value.

<div class="v" id="v1"><span class="vn">1</span> The second book of the prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, the son of Azaraias, the son of Helkias, the son of Salemas, the son of Sadoc, the son of Ahitob,</div>
<div class="v" id="v2"><span class="vn">2</span> the son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son of Marimoth, the son of Arna, the son of Ozias, the son of Borith, the son of Abissei, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar,</div>
<div class="v" id="v3"><span class="vn">3</span> the son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi, who was captive in the land of the Medes, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of the Persians.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v4"><span class="vn">4</span> The Lord’s word came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="v" id="v5"><span class="vn">5</span> “Go your way and show my people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they have done against me, that they may tell their children’s children,</div>
<div class="v" id="v6"><span class="vn">6</span> because the sins of their fathers have increased in them, for they have forgotten me, and have offered sacrifices to foreign gods.</div>
<div class="v" id="v7"><span class="vn">7</span> Didn’t I bring them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage? But they have provoked me to wrath and have despised my counsels.</div>
<div class="v" id="v8"><span class="vn">8</span> So pull out the hair of your head and cast all evils upon them, for they have not been obedient to my law, but they are a rebellious people.</div>
<div class="v" id="v9"><span class="vn">9</span> How long shall I endure them, to whom I have done so much good?</div>
<div class="v" id="v10"><span class="vn">10</span> I have overthrown many kings for their sakes. I have struck down Pharoah with his servants and all his army.</div>
<div class="v" id="v11"><span class="vn">11</span> I have destroyed all the nations before them. In the east, I have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyre and Sidon, and have slain all their adversaries.</div>
<div class="v" id="v12"><span class="vn">12</span> Speak therefore to them, saying:<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v13"><span class="vn">13</span> “The Lord says, truly I brought you through the sea, and where there was no path I made highways for you. I gave you Moses for a leader and Aaron for a priest.</div>
<div class="v" id="v14"><span class="vn">14</span> I gave you light in a pillar of fire. I have done great wonders among you, yet you have forgotten me, says the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v15"><span class="vn">15</span> “The Lord Almighty says: The quails were for a token to you. I gave you a camp for your protection, but you complained there.</div>
<div class="v" id="v16"><span class="vn">16</span> You didn’t celebrate in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but even to this day you still complain.</div>
<div class="v" id="v17"><span class="vn">17</span> Where are the benefits that I have given you? When you were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, didn’t you cry to me,</div>
<div class="v" id="v18"><span class="vn">18</span> saying, ‘Why have you brought us into this wilderness to kill us? It would have been better for us to have served the Egyptians than to die in this wilderness.’</div>
<div class="v" id="v19"><span class="vn">19</span> I had pity on your mourning and gave you manna for food. You ate angels’ bread.</div>
<div class="v" id="v20"><span class="vn">20</span> When you were thirsty, didn’t I split the rock, and water flowed out in abundance? Because of the heat, I covered you with the leaves of the trees.</div>
<div class="v" id="v21"><span class="vn">21</span> I divided fruitful lands among you. I drove out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines before you. What more shall I do for you?” says the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v22"><span class="vn">22</span> The Lord Almighty says, “When you were in the wilderness, at the bitter stream, being thirsty and blaspheming my name,</div>
<div class="v" id="v23"><span class="vn">23</span> I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but threw a tree in the water, and made the river sweet.</div>
<div class="v" id="v24"><span class="vn">24</span> What shall I do to you, O Jacob? You, Judah, would not obey me. I will turn myself to other nations, and I will give my name to them, that they may keep my statutes.</div>
<div class="v" id="v25"><span class="vn">25</span> Since you have forsaken me, I also will forsake you. When you ask me to be merciful to you, I will have no mercy upon you.</div>
<div class="v" id="v26"><span class="vn">26</span> Whenever you call upon me, I will not hear you, for you have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift to commit murder.</div>
<div class="v" id="v27"><span class="vn">27</span> It is not as though you have forsaken me, but your own selves,” says the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v28"><span class="vn">28</span> The Lord Almighty says, “Haven’t I asked you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babies,</div>
<div class="v" id="v29"><span class="vn">29</span> that you would be my people, and I would be your God, that you would be my children, and I would be your father?</div>
<div class="v" id="v30"><span class="vn">30</span> I gathered you together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But now, what should I do to you? I will cast you out from my presence.</div>
<div class="v" id="v31"><span class="vn">31</span> When you offer burnt sacrifices to me, I will turn my face from you, for I have rejected your solemn feast days, your new moons, and your circumcisions of the flesh.</div>
<div class="v" id="v32"><span class="vn">32</span> I sent to you my servants the prophets, whom you have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require from you,” says the Lord.<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v33"><span class="vn">33</span> The Lord Almighty says, “Your house is desolate. I will cast you out as the wind blows stubble.</div>
<div class="v" id="v34"><span class="vn">34</span> Your children won’t be fruitful, for they have neglected my commandment to you, and done that which is evil before me.</div>
<div class="v" id="v35"><span class="vn">35</span> I will give your houses to a people that will come, which not having heard of me yet believe me. Those to whom I have shown no signs will do what I have commanded.</div>
<div class="v" id="v36"><span class="vn">36</span> They have seen no prophets, yet they will remember their former condition.</div>
<div class="v" id="v37"><span class="vn">37</span> I call to witness the grattitude of the people who will come, whose little ones rejoice with gladness. Although they see me not with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they will believe what I say.”<span class="br-p"><br><br></span></div>
<div class="v" id="v38"><span class="vn">38</span> And now, father, behold with glory, and see the people that come from the east:</div>
<div class="v" id="v39"><span class="vn">39</span> to whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and Jonas,</div>
<div class="v" id="v40"><span class="vn">40</span> Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus, Zachary, and Malachy, who is also called the Lord’s messenger.</div>
